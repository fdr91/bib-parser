  abstract =     "This paper reviews the many theoretical considerations
                 and problems behind pipelining, surveying and comparing
                 various representative pipeline machines that operate
                 in either sequential or vector pipeline mode, the
                 practical solutions adopted, and the tradeoffs
                 involved. The performance of a simple pipe, the
                 physical speed limitation, and the control structures
                 for penalty-incurring events are analyzed separately.
                 The problems faced by the system designers are tackled,
                 including buffering, busing structure branching, and
                 interrupt handling. Aspects of sequential and vector
                 processing are studied. Fundamental advantages of
                 vector processing are unveiled, and additional
                 requirements (costs) are discussed to establish a
                 criterion for the tradeoff between sequential and
                 vector pipeline processing. Finally, two recent
                 machines (the Cray-1 and the Amdahl 470 V/6 systems)
                 are presented to demonstrate how complex pipeline
                 techniques can be used and how simple but advantageous
                 pipeline concepts can be exploited.",

                 performed for a turbulent, transonic, normal-shock wave
                 boundary-layer interaction in a wind-tunnel diffuser.
                 The vectorized three-dimensional Navier--Stokes code on
                 the CRAY-1 computer achieved a speed of 128 times that
                 of the original scalar code processed by a CYBER 74
                 computer. The vectorized version of the code
                 outperforms the scalar code on the CRAY computer by a
                 factor of 8. 13. A comparison between the experimental
                 data and the numerical simulation is also made.",

                 large numerical models of the atmosphere and weather
                 forecasting models. In particular a new operational
                 forecast model has been developed for this computer and
                 this is being coded to take full advantage of the

                 is shown that in general numerical weather prediction

                 large numerical models of the atmosphere and weather
                 forecasting models. In particular a new operational
                 forecast model has been developed for this computer and
                 this is being coded to take full advantage of the
                 vector capabilities of this machine. Development
                 versions of this model have also been run on a Cray-1
                 at the European Centre for Medium Range Weather
                 Forecasts. This has presented the opportunity to
                 compare some of the features of these two computers. It
                 is shown that in general numerical weather prediction
                 models can be split into two sections, the dynamical
                 and physical process. In the dynamical processes the
                 same operations are applied at every point in the
                 integration domain and so these processes are readily
                 vectorizable. However, the physical processes are
                 conditional and intermittent in nature and use must be

                 probabilistic-detecting code with b equals 5, k equals

                 probabilistic double-error-detection capability of the
                 code was performed for different organizations
                 encompassing the traditional feature of memory data
                 error protection and also providing for the detection

                 affecting the interconnection network communication

  abstract =     "One of the significant differences between the CRAY
                 X-MP and its predecessor, the CRAY-1S, is a
                 considerably increased memory bandwidth for vector
                 operations. The authors describe the CRAY X-MP
                 interleaved memory system, focusing on steady-state
                 performance for sequences of vector operations. Because
                 it is more amenable to analysis, they first study the
                 interaction of vector streams issued from a single
                 processor. They identify the occurrence of linked
                 conflicts, repeating sequences of conflicts between two
                 or more vector streams that result in reduced
                 steady-state performance. Worst-case and average-case
                 performance measures are given. The discussion then
                 turns to dual processor interactions. Here, conflicts
                 involving ports belonging to the same processor tend to
                 dominate performance. Finally, on the basis of this
                 analysis, possible modifications to the CRAY X-MP
                 memory system are proposed and compared. These
                 modifications are intended to eliminate or reduce the

                 new dimensions for application development, especially
                 in a scientific environment. It also challenges the
                 computer center to integrate inherently incompatible
                 systems. Several methods to accommodate the user's
                 needs for a unified access to both conventional and new
                 systems are conceivable. They result in systems of
                 different degrees of homogeneity. Practical experiences
                 with the integration of a CRAY into both an MVS and a
                 VM\slash CMS environment are presented. Areas requiring
                 additional development are outlined and the position of
                 today's supercomputers as a step towards the future in
                 high speed computing is discussed.",

  abstract =     "ACTUS, a Pascal based parallel language, was designed
                 to facilitate the programming of array and vector
                 processors. As the language is intended to be used on a
                 variety of computer systems it is clear that
                 portability must be given a high priority. It is
                 equally clear that the wide variation in machine
                 architectures will impose certain limitations on any
                 implementation of the language. This conflict may be
                 resolved by using a multi-pass scheme for the
                 implementation process thereby allowing machine
                 dependent and machine independent sections of the
                 implementation to be dealt with in distinct operations.
                 This paper describes an implementation of ACTUS
                 intended for use on a vector processor, the CRAY-1,
                 outlining the typical operations that are carried out
                 during the various passes of the compilation process.",

                 overhead on a single CPU of the CRAY X-MP, and the
                 overhead of splitting a job between the two CPUs of a
                 CRAY X-MP. Interpreted in terms of the parameters (r//
                 infinity, n//1/////2) the authors concludes that the
                 CRAY X-MP is about three times faster than the CRAY-1
                 in asymptotic performance r// infinity, however this
                 has the effect of similarly increasing the
                 half-performance length, n//1/////2. Measurements of
                 job splitting between two CPUs interpreted in terms of
                 the parameters (r// infinity s//1/////2) show that the
                 cost of job synchronization in terms of lost
                 floating-point operations is about ten times more
                 expensive on the CRAY X-MP than on the Denelcor HEP1.
                 This means that the grain size of jobs split between
                 two CPUs needs to be about ten times larger on the CRAY
                 X-MP than on the HEP1 in order to achieve the same

  abstract =     "This paper presents the results of a study of the
                 application of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient
                 algorithm to some equations arising in
                 three-dimensional turbulent flow prediction. The merits
                 of several of the standard preconditionings are
                 discussed, and some of the difficulties which are
                 encountered when trying to solve such problems
                 efficiently on a vector computer are described. The
                 results show that the coefficient matrices which arise
                 have important differences from those which derive from
                 many standard test problems. Efficient solution of the
                 problems is still possible, but the correct choice of
                 preconditioning is important. In particular, the
                 application of truncated power series expansions to the
                 preconditioning phase is shown to produce substantial
                 gains.",

                 mechanisms were not designed for general use and hence
                 were neither flexible nor efficient. Additionally,
                 multitasking as an integrated feature (user libraries
                 and operating system) needed to vary the number of
                 processors working on a problem quickly. We
                 subsequently implemented simpler mechanisms in the user
                 libraries and operating system. The new mechanisms
                 exploit the speed of a set of hardware registers which
                 are shared among cooperating CPUs to achieve the needed
                 performance. In retrospect, we saw how neatly a
                 data-flow paradigm fit our design.",

  abstract =     "One of the significant improvements of the CRAY X-MP
                 over its predecessor, the CRAY-1S, is increased memory
                 bandwidth for vector operations. Up to three vector
                 streams in each of the two processors can be active
                 simultaneously. These streams contend for memory banks
                 as well as for data paths. All memory conflicts are
                 resolved dynamically by the memory system. A simulation
                 study of the CRAY X-MP interleaved memory system is
                 described, with attention focused on steady-state
                 performance for sequences of vector operations. Because
                 it is more amenable to analysis, the interaction of
                 vector streams issued from a single processor is
                 studied first. The authors identify the occurrence of
                 linked conflicts, that is, repeating sequences of
                 conflicts between two or more vector streams that
                 result in reduced steady-state performance. Both
                 worst-case and average case performance measures are
                 given. Dual processor interactions are then discussed.
                 Based on simulations, possible modifications to the
                 CRAY X-MP memory system, intended to eliminate or
                 reduce the effects of linked conflicts, are proposed
                 and compared.",

                 such as vector and array processors, have been designed
                 using one of the following two approaches: (1) an
                 existing sequential language is adapted, (2) a new
                 language based on the hardware is developed. Recently,
                 there has emerged a third approach, which does not
                 require the programmer to be aware of the sequential
                 nature of the language or the hardware characteristics.
                 Examples of these language groups are examined to
                 illustrate their main features and what is required of
                 a programmer when using such languages. The study
                 therefore enables a comparison of the different

                 for the solution of symmetric linear systems is studied
                 in the context of multiprocessing. A totally parallel
                 approach is taken based on a computational model of an
                 MIMD machine with shared global memory. In order to
                 assure mathematical correctness of the algorithm, four
                 barrier syncs are required during each iteration. Large
                 linear systems are solved with this parallel adaptation
                 of conjugate gradient and efficiencies near one
                 observed on the CRAY X-MP24 running COS 1. 13. Further,
                 segments of the code which could be considered
                 independent (i.e. between syncs) clocked in at speedups
                 very close to the number of tasks. The latter indicates
                 that the loss efficiency in this implementation of the
                 algorithm on the X-MP24 is connected with the cost of
                 barrier syncs. On the CRAY X-MP48 running COS 1. 15
                 similar results are observed utilizing two CPU's. When
                 all four CPU's execute parallel tasks in vector mode
                 memory bank conflicts cause a 30\% loss of overall
                 speedup.",

  abstract =     "The recent success of vector computers such as the
                 Cray-1 and array processors such as those manufactured
                 by Floating Point Systems has increased interest in
                 making vector operations available to the FORTRAN
                 programmer. The FORTRAN standards committee is
                 currently considering a successor to FORTRAN 77,
                 usually called FORTRAN 8x, that will permit the
                 programmer to explicitly specify vector and array
                 operations. Although FORTRAN 8x will make it convenient
                 to specify explicit vector operations in new programs,
                 it does little for existing code. In order to benefit
                 from the power of vector hardware, existing programs
                 will need to be rewritten in some language, presumably
                 FORTRAN 8x, that permits the explicit specification of
                 vector operations. One way to avoid a massive manual
                 recoding effort is to provide a translator that
                 discovers the parallelism implicit in a FORTRAN program
                 and automatically rewrites that program in FORTRAN 8x.
                 Such a translation from FORTRAN to FORTRAN 8x is not
                 straightforward because FORTRAN DO loops are not always
                 semantically equivalent to the corresponding FORTRAN 8x
                 parallel operation. The semantic difference between
                 these two constructs is precisely captured by the
                 concept of dependence. A translation from FORTRAN to
                 FORTRAN 8x preserves the semantics of the original
                 program if it preserves the dependences in that
                 program. The theoretical background is developed here
                 for employing data dependence to convert FORTRAN
                 programs to parallel form. Dependence is defined and
                 characterized in terms of the conditions that give rise
                 to it; accurate tests to determine dependence are
                 presented; and transformations that use dependence to
                 uncover additional parallelism are discussed.",

                 the computation and evaluation of interpolating
                 polynomials. The algorithms make use of fast parallel
                 prefix techniques for the calculation of divided
                 differences in the Newton representation of the
                 interpolating polynomial. For n+1 given input pairs the
                 proposed interpolation algorithm requires 2[log(n+1)]+2
                 parallel arithmetic steps and circuit size O(np2s). The
                 algorithms are numerically stable and their
                 floating-point implementation results in error
                 accumulation similar to that of the widely used serial
                 algorithms. This is in contrast to other fast serial
                 and parallel interpolation algorithms which are subject
                 to much larger roundoff. We demonstrate that in a
                 distributed memory environment context, a cube
                 connected system is very suitable for the algorithms'
                 implementation, exhibiting very small communication
                 cost. As further advantages we note that our techniques
                 does not require equidistant points, preconditioning,

                 Engines, the way aerodynamic design takes place is
                 changing. By reducing the computing time required by
                 applications programs, the CRAY has had two major
                 effects: it has made it possible to run computational
                 flow models that could not have been seriously
                 addressed until now, and it has made more routine
                 calculations almost interactive. Typical results can be
                 obtained from the CRAY up to 300 times faster than from
                 a VAX 11\slash 780, a standard engineering design
                 computer. The aerodynamic codes currently used on the
                 CRAY work in two or three spatial dimensions and can
                 accommodate both inviscid approximations and viscous
                 solutions. In general, as more dimensions or viscous
                 terms are added, the codes become more complex and
                 therefore more expensive to run. The TRIAD2D code
                 provides an example. Other, more complex codes, are

                 (floating-point operations per second). To achieve
                 ultrahigh speed at modest power levels, GaAs IC logic
                 was selected. Performance levels of less than 150
                 ps\slash gate are achieved using a custom GaAs IC
                 logic-cell approach comprised of 40-80 multilevel logic
                 cells equivalent to 200-300 GaAs logic gates. An
                 efficient fast-turn design methodology has been

                 systems. This 16 multiplied by 16 Cray multiplier
                 design has been implemented under the constraint of
                 using a standard Fairchild FGE2500 ECL gate array,
                 packaged in a pin-grid array. It demonstrates the
                 turnaround-time and design-cost advantages of ECL gate

                 discusses how and why it is used, and provides several
                 examples of how CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)
                 codes have been microtasked and executed on CRAY X-MP
                 multiprocessor computer systems. In the examples shown
                 and in many other codes now being modified by CRAY
                 supercomputer users, microtasking has proven to be a
                 relatively simple means of using multiple processors.
                 The major attributes of microtasking are: (A) low
                 overhead, (B) ease of implementation, and (C)
                 portability, i.e., microtasked codes can be run without
                 modification on any computer. Experience has shown that
                 CFD codes of many types can be easily and effectively
                 microtasked, due to their inherent use of numerous,
                 computationally intensive DO-LOOPS. The large memory
                 and long run time requirements of such codes make them
                 natural candidates for microtasking.",

  abstract =     "Program restructuring is a subject that has been
                 studied for many years by a few researchers, and which
                 has attracted great attention in recent years [AlCo72],
                 [AlKe82], [Bane76], [Bane79], [Cytr84], [Kuck78],
                 [Padu79], [PaWo86], [Poly86], [Wolf82]. Many
                 vectorizing compilers have been developed in the past
                 ten years [KKLW80], [Alli85], [Kenn80], [Brod81].
                 However, restructuring for parallel machines is still a
                 relatively new subject. Some of the parallelizing
                 compilers under development are the University of
                 Illinois Parafrase II, the Rice University PFC, and the
                 IBM PTRAN. In this paper we discuss two new techniques
                 for transforming serial programs into a parallel form
                 suitable for execution on parallel processor systems.
                 These schemes can be implemented in a restructuring
                 compiler with minimal effort, and for certain types of
                 serial loops they can obtain significant improvement.
                 More specifically, we discuss in detail cycle
                 shrinking, a compiler transformation that can partially
                 parallelize certain types of serial loops. Three
                 versions of this transformation (based on different
                 uses of dependence distance information) are presented
                 and compared. The second major subject of this paper is
                 run-time dependence analysis, through compiler-inserted
                 bookkeeping and control statements. Loops with
                 unstructured parallelism that cannot benefit from
                 existing optimizations, can be parallelized through
                 run-time dependence checking. The rest of the material
                 is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a short
                 introductions to program dependences and defines the
                 basic concepts. Section 3 discusses cycle shrinking in
                 detail; Section 3.1 covers singly nested loops, while
                 Section 3.2 discusses the application of cycle
                 shrinking to complex nested loops. Run-time dependence
                 checking and the RDC transformation are presented in
                 Section 4. The conclusion is given in Section 5.",

  abstract =     "It has been shown that parallelism is a very promising
                 alternative for enhancing computer performance.
                 Parallelism, however, introduces much complexity to the
                 programming effort. This has lead [sic] to the
                 development of automatic concurrency extraction
                 techniques. Prior work demonstrated that static program
                 restructuring via compiler based techniques provides a
                 large degree of parallelism to the target machine.
                 Purely hardware based extraction techniques (without
                 software preprocessing) have also demonstrated
                 significant (but lesser) degrees of parallelism. This
                 paper considers the performance effects of the
                 combination of both hardware and software techniques.
                 The concurrency extracted from a given set of
                 benchmarks by each technique separately, and together,
                 is determined via simulations and/or analysis. The
                 `common parallelism' extracted by the two methods is
                 thus also considered, using new metrics. The analytic
                 techniques for predicting the performance of specific
                 programs are also considered.",

                 developed calculation procedure for multidimensional
                 recirculating fluid flows. The solution algorithm uses
                 a coupled Gauss--Seidel relaxation operator in
                 conjunction with the multigrid technique. The
                 vectorization is performed on a CRAY X-MP\slash 48
                 using a single processor. In this paper, the
                 vectorization techniques used and the observed
                 speed-ups are presented for a model problem of laminar
                 flow in a two-dimensional square cavity. Large scale
                 calculations with up to one quarter of a million finite
                 difference cells (512 multiplied by 512) have been made

                 when finite differencing is used to approximate
                 solutions of partial differential equations. An
                 iterative method commonly used with sparse systems is
                 the method of Preconditioned Conjugate Gradients (PCG).
                 We describe a technique for reducing a given matrix
                 with property A into a reduced matrix which involves
                 half the number of original unknowns. The
                 implementation of this technique and its performance on
                 the Alliant FX/8 multiprocessor are discussed. Three
                 different preconditioned methods for the reduced system
                 are compared. For the model problems considered, it is
                 shown that with Diagonal Scaling as a preconditioner,
                 the reduced system method is on the average 2.7 times

                 state. Should the kernel ever detect a variation from
                 that state, a system panic occurs, and the system
                 `crashes'. For this reason it is important that the
                 integrity of the file system be checked before bringing
                 any UNIX system up in multi-user mode. A file system

                 state of the file system and fix them, if possible, to
                 prevent system panics. Unfortunately, on a system with

                 probably have to be booted frequently, the (highly
                 desirable) use of fsck can begin to waste valuable work
                 time. In an attempt to solve this problem, fsck was
                 studied in detail, and then modified to perform its
                 tasks more efficiently. This paper first describes the
                 function of the original fsck program to convey the
                 basic goals it sets out to accomplish. The next section
                 points out inefficiencies that were found in the
                 original algorithms, and describes how these
                 inefficiencies were alleviated. A number of timing
                 measurements were taken to locate the original
                 problems, and then later to show that the modifications
                 did provide significant improvement. Our new fsck was
                 tested to ensure it retained all the diagnostic and
                 corrective capabilities of the original. It was also
                 ported to a different machine to demonstrate its
                 general usefulness in any BSD based UNIX environment.
                 Compared to the version of fsck distributed with BSD
                 4.2 or 4.3, our fsck consistently runs 2 to 3 times
                 faster, and reboot times (with file system checks) have
                 been cut almost in half. Real time measurements for our
                 fsck on the three machines where it has been installed
                 are given in the concluding section.",

  abstract =     "In this age of explicit parallel programming in a
                 shared memory model, one of the major difficulties is
                 identifying and eliminating the causes of
                 non-determinacy. This paper discusses this problem and
                 presents a method for automatically detecting sources
                 of non-determinancy in parallel programs that utilize
                 event style synchronization instructions. There will
                 always be some shared variables in an explicitly
                 parallel program, and the individual parallel tasks of
                 the program must be properly synchonized when accessing
                 these variables. With event style synchronization,
                 especially when there are many references to the same
                 event, the difficulty lies in identifying those
                 statements that are synchronized with each particular
                 event wait operation. We demonstrate an algorithm that
                 solves this problem, yielding a task graph upon which a
                 race detection algorithm can be applied.",

                 factor in the performance of supercomputers.
                 Consequently, one of the major concerns when developing
                 a high-performance code, either manually or
                 automatically, is determining and characterizing the
                 influence of the memory system on performance in terms
                 of algorithmic parameters. Unfortunately, the
                 performance data available to an algorithm designer
                 such as various benchmarks and, occasionally,
                 manufacturer-supplied information, e.g. instruction
                 timings and architecture component characteristics, are
                 rarely sufficient for this task. In this paper, we
                 discuss a methodology for probing the performance
                 characteristics of a memory system via a hierarchy of
                 data-movement kernels and predicting the performance of
                 Fortan codes by a combination of the empirical
                 observations, architectural models and analytical
                 techniques. We also consider the viability of the

                 careful choice of adequate algorithms as for an
                 implementation taking into account the particular
                 architecture. To demonstrate these facts, a parallel
                 algorithm to find an approximate solution to the
                 Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (ETSP) is
                 presented. The algorithm is a parallelization of Karp's
                 partitioning algorithm. It is a divide-and-conquer
                 method for solving the ETSP approximately. Since the
                 successor vertex in the tour is usually a nearby
                 vertex, the problem can be `geographically' partitioned
                 into subproblems which then can be solved
                 independently. The resulting subtours can be combined
                 into a single tour which is an approximate solution to
                 the ETSP. The algorithm is implemented on a CRAY X-MP
                 with two and four processors, and results using
                 macrotasking and microtasking are presented.",

                 Generalized Cube network (or the Omega network) is
                 proposed. The proposed network is derived from the
                 Generalized Cube network by adding multiplexers and
                 demultiplexers at the input stage and the output stage
                 respectively. A critical problem in any interconnection
                 network is that a single fault in either the initial or
                 last stage disconnects the source or destination from
                 the rest of the network. A solution to this critical
                 condition is obtained using the proposed design.
                 Further advantages of the proposed design in contrast
                 to others are its simple control scheme and its low
                 cost to achieve a fault tolerant design. This proposed
                 network can also tolerate any single fault in the mode
                 of one-to-one or multicast connections.",

                 more concise, transparent recurrence formulas utilizing
                 a new and conceptually simple model of the ADM. As a
                 byproduct, a global control algorithm for the inverse
                 augmented data manipulator (IADM) is obtained, which
                 can set paths for all the IADM-passable permutations.
                 This algorithm can be adapted for the ADM. The paper
                 also includes two new local control algorithms for the

                 traces of all of the processors. While temporal
                 locality improves within the processor as the number of
                 processors used to execute the program is increased,
                 the ability of the caches to hide the long memory delay
                 is reduced due to reference spreading. Also, the cache
                 coherence problem further reduces the effectiveness of
                 the caches as the number of processors is increased. A
                 trace-driven simulator is used to show that when data
                 prefetching is combined with a cache, the miss ratio is
                 no longer a good metric for evaluating processor
                 performance. The standard deviation of intermiss
                 distance multiplied by the miss ratio is proposed as a
                 new performance metric which accurately correlates with
                 execution time.",

                 accommodate several users simultaneously in order to
                 keep system utilization high. Parallel programs can be
                 explicitly written in a parallel language, or they can
                 be the result of automatic restructuring of serial
                 programs. In order to efficiently exploit the
                 parallelism present in such programs we need to obtain
                 good schedules of parallel constructs on the many
                 processors of a parallel machine. The operating system
                 of a parallel machine needs to accommodate several
                 parallel programs. Providing effective parallel
                 processing in a multiprogramming environment is an

                 Cray Y-MP which are important to using the whole
                 machine for one program, and compared timings for the
                 Y-MP to is X-MP predecessor. In the area of memory
                 contention, the performance of matrix multiplication
                 coded to use only one memory port per clock period per
                 CPU scales linearly with the number of processors.
                 Using three memory ports per clock period per CPU
                 produces less than linear speedups. From this it is
                 concluded that for parallel applications the number of
                 ports from each CPU to central memory may not be as
                 important as the number of ports which can be
                 referenced from the same program on all CPUs and still
                 provide linear speed-ups. In the area of shared
                 registers, the authors looked at execution times of the
                 standard Cray microtasking critical regions. These
                 timings have slowed down on the Y-MP, but not as much
                 as the timings for the shared register instructions
                 might predict. A positive result of the timings is that
                 extra CPUs do not slow down the speed of the critical
                 regions for prior CPUs. Thus there is not need to worry
                 about getting too many CPUs into a program and hurting
                 overall performance. The slowdown of the critical
                 region highlights the difficulty of providing very fast
                 shared registers as the number of communicating CPUs
                 grows.",

                 great deal of attention has been given to executing
                 Prolog in parallel. A question which naturally arises
                 is how to execute standard sequential Prolog programs
                 with side effects in parallel. The problem of
                 performing side effects in AND parallel systems has
                 been considered elsewhere. This thesis describes the
                 design and implementation of an interpreter which
                 ensures sequential semantics of side effect predicates
                 in an OR parallel system. First, a general method is
                 given for performing data side effects such as read and
                 write. This method is then extended to control side
                 effects such as asserta, assertz, and retract. A
                 constant-time algorithm for performing cut is then
                 presented. Lastly, the implementation of the
                 interpreter on the Alliant FX/8 multiprocessor is
                 described, and some performance figures are given.",

                 part on how well the communication structure of the
                 algorithm is matched to the communication structure of
                 the target parallel system. The mapping problem is the
                 problem of generating such a match algorithmically.
                 Solving the mapping problem optimally for any
                 non-trivial case is NP-complete. Therefore, a heuristic
                 approach must be used to solve the problem. Although
                 several heuristic algorithms to this problem have been
                 developed, their performance has been evaluated on
                 relatively few combinations of communication and
                 processor structures. This paper extensively evaluates
                 the performance of hill climbing mapping algorithms

                 representative of existing parallel algorithms and

                 follows: to establish the differences in performance
                 between variations of the hill climbing heuristic; to
                 determine the factors which affect the performance of
                 hill climbing with respect to optimum; and to compare
                 hill climbing to known optimum and non-optimum mappings
                 to determine the effectiveness of hill climbing as a
                 mapping heuristic.",

  abstract =     "Most time-domain, wave modeling problems in geophysics
                 are intractable by classical analysis methods, due
                 principally to nonseparability and to a lesser extent
                 material nonlinearity. Therefore discrete numerical
                 solutions are often necessary for the simulation of
                 realistic models. Applications in 2-D and 3-D
                 geophysical modeling are the subject of this paper,
                 particularly as solved on a CRAY-2 supercomputer.
                 Implementation and performance differences between
                 earlier CRAYs and CRAY-2 are described, including the
                 discrepancy between scalar fetch and vector processing
                 speeds. Explicit finite element solvers are applied to
                 applications involving 2-D simulation of a seismic
                 refraction experiment across the state of Maine, 3-D
                 simulation of near-source scattering experiments, and
                 both linear and nonlinear axisymmetric source
                 simulation. Results show that the CRAY-2 allows
                 cost-effective 2-D simulations of truly large-scale
                 models, but only begins to be effective in 3-D for
                 models of interest in geophysics.",

                 of programs, to facilitate automatic parallelization.
                 While previous methods result in programs whose control
                 flow graphs are reducible, programs normalized by our
                 technique satisfy a stronger condition than
                 reducibility, and are therefore simpler in their syntax
                 and structure than with previous methods. In
                 particular, all control flow cycles are normalized into
                 single-entry, single-exit while-loops, and all goto's
                 are eliminated. This restructuring obviates the control
                 dependence graph, since afterwards control dependence

                 are examined as a function of both the loop scheduling

                 variations in loop iteration execution times with both

                 thirteen Fortran programs that total well over 50,000
                 lines of source code. They represent applications in a
                 number of areas of engineering and scientific
                 computing, and in many cases they represent codes that
                 are currently used by a number of computational
                 research and development groups. We also present the
                 PERFECT Fortran standard which is simply a set of
                 guidelines that allow portability to a number of types
                 of machines. Furthermore, we present some performance
                 measures and a methodology for recording and sharing
                 results among a group of diverse users on different
                 machines. The second portion of the paper presents some
                 of the results we have obtained over the past year and
                 a half. The results should not be used to compare

  abstract =     "A pass to the Cedar Fortran preprocessor, cftn, has
                 been developed which allows the user to instrument his
                 source code in a variety of ways. By specifying
                 different command line options and linking with
                 different libraries, one can automatically generate a
                 report of the program's use of the Alliant FX/8's or
                 Cedar's vector hardware, or apply several types of
                 error analysis to obtain an indication of the numerical
                 stabilty of the algorithm and its implementation. A
                 library has been written with which the user can link
                 to obtain a report of floating point operation counts,
                 together with information regarding each type of
                 operation or intrinsic function call, whether the
                 operation is performed on scalar or array operands, and
                 if so, the length and stride of the vector(s) involved.
                 The package is called the OPCT package, and has been
                 integrated into the Faust programming environment under
                 development at CSRD. A library for statistical roundoff
                 error analysis has also been developed for use on the
                 Alliant FX/8 or Cedar. A random perturbation is applied
                 to each result of an arithmetic operation, and this is
                 used in the context of existing statistical models in
                 order to detect numerical instability. The package is
                 called PERTURB, and an implementation of it has also
                 been integrated into the Faust programming environment.
                 One may also use the preprocessor to generate at
                 run-time a graph of the floating point computations
                 performed in the program. The graph generated by the
                 LGRAPH package is suitable for input directly into
                 certain error analysis packages.",

                 problem is subdivided into parallel tasks each of which
                 exploits the vector capabilities of the processors.
                 Cedar can use three levels of parallelism; large grain
                 by dividing the task among the clusters, medium grain
                 by dividing the subtasks further among processors, and
                 fine grain by using vectorization. Full utilization of
                 these capabilities requires careful examination of the
                 behavior of the CG algorithm on the machines and
                 innovative ways of applying it to new problems. This
                 paper presents three such approaches. First, the
                 performance of preconditioning methods is considered,
                 and the tradeoffs in choosing methods on a shared
                 memory multiprocessor are examined. Secondly, an
                 operator splitting technique for structural mechanics
                 problems is described which creates parallel subtasks
                 that can then be solved using the CG algorithm. This
                 not only gives a preconditioner for CG that is suitable
                 for multiprocessors, but also can give a superior
                 sequential algorithm. Finally, a projection based
                 scheme for solving nonsymmetric linear systems is
                 presented which uses CG acceleration. This scheme
                 provides a parallel implementation for multiprocessing,
                 and leads to an algorithm that is more robust than
                 other nonsymmetric solvers.",

                 scheme for certain classes of discretized physical

                 into independent or loosely coupled subproblems by
                 taking advantage of symmetry or partial symmetry. This
                 is achieved by exploiting important properties

                 method to 3D isotropic elasticity problems using the
                 (preconditioned) conjugate gradient algorithm. The
                 method is first applied to problems with symmetric
                 domains and boundary conditions. We then extend its
                 application to general asymmetric problems by choosing
                 the preconditioner to be the stiffness matrix of some
                 symmetrically discretized substructure. This method is
                 not only superior to classical schemes on sequential
                 computers, but also lends itself to efficient
                 implementation on multiprocessors with several levels
                 of parallelism.",

                 instruments common Fortran programs, then compiles and
                 executes them on most general computer systems. The
                 main goal of the MaxPar simulator is to measure the
                 inherent parallelism and the maximal parallelism
                 extractable within resource constraints. It simulates
                 the parallel execution time of Fortran programs but
                 preserves their semantics by observing the necessary
                 dependences. Several features enable MaxPar to simulate
                 many realistic execution models. The results are very
                 useful in identifying the serial bottlenecks in
                 programs. Experimental results from MaxPar show
                 significant parallelism in scientific and engineering
                 benchmarks. Preliminary study suggests the importance
                 of interprocedural analysis and loop level parallelism.
                 Fine-grain parallelism is more sensitive to processor
                 scheduling strategy than coarse-grain parallelism,
                 although the latter is more vulnerable to
                 storage-related dependences. The effect of
                 self-scheduling overhead due to the contention of
                 accessing loop index variables is also examined.
                 MaxPar's potential applications in other interesting

                 major obstacle in using private cache memory to reduce
                 memory access latency in large-scale multiprocessor
                 systems. Two compiler-directed solutions, the fast
                 selective invalidation scheme and the version control
                 scheme, are proposed in this work. Contrary to the
                 existing hardware-based approach, the proposed schemes
                 expose caches to software-directed management
                 techniques which have the advantage of requiring no
                 global communication and maintaining expandability of
                 the multiprocessor systems. The fast selective scheme
                 employs compile-time flow analysis techniques to detect
                 cache data that contain obsolete values, and uses
                 simple hardware to prevent using such data. The version
                 control scheme defines the concept of version of a
                 program variable to maintain up-to-date copies in the
                 cache and solves the difficult problem of preserving
                 temporal locality in parallel execution. Unlike
                 existing software-directed schemes, both schemes
                 achieve selective invalidation with very low time
                 penalty. The version control scheme is also extended to
                 hierarchical cache systems for which no satisfactory
                 solutions exist. Detailed discussion on the development
                 of these schemes and their proofs are presented.
                 Finally, experimental data by simulation are shown to
                 support the advantage of the schemes.",

                 interconnection networks. Compiler-directed coherence
                 enforcement has been proposed as an alternative for
                 such systems. We discuss three different
                 compiler-assisted cache coherence enforcement schemes
                 developed at the University of Illinois. All three rely
                 on a compiler to detect potential coherence problems
                 and generate code to enforce coherence in a parallel
                 program. The main goals are to maintain coherence
                 without any interprocessor communication and to keep
                 coherence enforcement overhead low. The former is
                 achieved by using compile-time knowledge of the
                 parallelism and data dependences in a program. The
                 latter is achieved by using special hardware to
                 invalidate stale cache blocks in time independent of
                 the number of such blocks. Cache words are allowed to
                 become inconsistent with memory as long as the compiler
                 decides it is safe to do so. The latest of the three
                 schemes also handles multi-level cache hierarchies and
                 does not require the `inclusion principle' to be
                 satisfied. The inherent cost of maintaining coherence
                 in parallel programs is also estimated. A qualitative

                 The new approach, unlike existing approaches for such
                 class of systems, makes it possible to exploit temporal
                 locality across synchronization boundaries. As with the
                 other software-directed approaches, each processor
                 independently manages its cache, i.e., there is no
                 interprocessor communication involved in maintaining
                 cache coherence. The hardware required per processor in
                 the version control approach stays constant as the
                 number of processors increases; hence, it scales up to
                 larger systems. Furthermore, the new approach incurs
                 low overhead. The simulated results of several schemes

  abstract =     "This thesis presents a parallel algorithm for the
                 direct LU factorization of general unsymmetric sparse
                 matrices. The algorithm, D2, is based on a new
                 nondeterministic parallel pivot search that finds a
                 compatible pivot set S of size m, followed by a
                 parallel rank-m update. These two steps alternate until
                 switching to dense matrix code or until the matrix is
                 factored. The algorithm is based on a shared-memory
                 MIMD model and takes advantage of both concurrency and
                 (gather-scatter) vectorization. Experimental
                 comparisons on an Alliant FX/8 show that the method
                 results in shorter elimination trees for matrices with
                 highly asymmetrical nonzero structure than those for
                 previous methods that work with the symmetric structure
                 of A+A[superscript T] or A[superscript T]A (such as
                 George and Ng's Sparspak-C or Duff and Reid's
                 multi-frontal method). The algorithm exploits more
                 parallelism in the pivot search phase than previous
                 algorithms which do not force a symmetric structure
                 onto the matrix during any phase of the factorization.
                 Additional experimental comparisons include fillin,
                 amount of work, numerical stability, memory usage, and
                 run time. The nondeterministic behavior of the D2
                 algorithm and other performance metrics are analyzed on
                 an Alliant FX/8, a Cray-2, and a Cray-XMP/48.
                 Enhancements to PSolve, a pairwise pivoting algorithm,
                 are discussed, and a software tool for developing
                 sparse matrix algorithms and observing their dynamic
                 behavior on a Sun workstation is presented. The tool
                 was instrumental in the development of the D2
                 algorithm. Possible extensions to the D2 algorithm are
                 discussed, including the use of dense matrix kernels
                 and replacing the synchronization structure in the
                 pivot search with a software combining tree.",

                 interpolation. These algorithms can be used for
                 constructing and evaluating polynomials interpolating
                 the function values and its derivatives of arbitrary
                 order (Hermite interpolation). For interpolation, the
                 parallel arithmetic complexity is O(log[superscript 2]M

                 the highest derivative information and N is the number
                 of distinct points used. Unlike alternate approaches
                 which use the Lagrange representation, the algorithms
                 described in this paper are based on the fast parallel
                 evaluation of a closed formula for the generalized
                 divided differences. Applications to the solution of

                 the proposed interpolation algorithm requires only

                 systems and is highly parallelizable. The two other

                 synchronization is crucial for high performance. One
                 proposed approach is that of the IBM RP3 project:
                 synchronization requests are separated from memory
                 requests, and a special multistage combining network is
                 used to handle synchronization. However, multistage
                 combining networks are expensive pieces of hardware. We
                 propose a cost-effective solution to the problem of
                 speeding up synchonization in a large-scale
                 multiprocessor system: a combining shuffle-exchange
                 network that gives better performance than software
                 synchonization schemes, and is cheaper than a
                 multistage combining network by a factor of logN, where

                 new and not well defined research area. At present,
                 there are no models for predicting or explaining the
                 performance of actual application programs. The only
                 models that do exist deal with very fundamental
                 operations, such as the performance of a vector machine
                 on a single, carefully defined vector operation. In
                 conjunction with this comes some relatively inaccurate
                 ideas on how to measure machine performance. For
                 instance, one technique that is still commonly used is
                 to compare machines on the basis of the fastest
                 possible performance rate of a machine, rather than its
                 typical rate on useful programs. Furthermore, it is a
                 common occurrence for evaluators to use two performance
                 measurements that are fundamentally different, such as
                 combining results on one machine that are taken under
                 widely differing conditions. In this paper, some
                 initial steps are taken to solve some of these
                 problems. Along with discussing the basic traditional
                 approaches, and their weaknesses, a new performance
                 model is suggested, and a complete approach to
                 supercomputer performance evaluation is outlined.",

  abstract =     "For A [in the set of] Z[x], let [formula] denote the
                 Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector of A and let
                 (A) denote the ideal in Z[x] generated by A. Define the
                 minimal Euclidean norm of A by [formula]. Given an
                 algebraic number gas with minimal polynomial A, define
                 the minimal Euclidean norm of gas by [formula]. Let A
                 [in the set of] Z[x] be irreducible over Z, and suppose
                 that either A has at least one root not on the unit
                 circle or A is a monic polynomial. We present an
                 algorithm which is guaranteed to find a polynomial P
                 [in the set of] (A) for which [formula] in finite time
                 dependent only on A. The complexity of the above
                 algorithm is investigated, and the performance of an
                 implementation in Mathematics is discussed. We obtain a
                 new result in Diophantine approximation using
                 techniques similar to those we developed to justify the
                 algorithm. In fact, let gas be a given nonzero
                 algebraic number with [formula]. If gbs is any
                 algebraic number distinct from gas with [formula], then
                 we obtain an effective lower bound for [formula] which
                 is independent of gbs. For example, [formula] for all
                 algebraic [formula] with [formula]. When [formula] and
                 [formula], such an isolation result is impossible
                 because the roots of unity are dense on the unit
                 circle. We show our algorithm is equivalent to finding
                 a shortest vector in an infinite union of certain
                 lattices. We also show how our effective lower bounds
                 can be used to resolve a certain two-person bit string
                 passing problem. Finally, we treat some related
                 questions in which the minimal Euclidean norm is
                 replaced by other suitable functions. Some open
                 problems are also discussed.",

                 numerically intensive application, especially when the
                 problem size is large as in the case of VLSI circuits.
                 To improve the performance of circuit simulators
                 without sacrificing accuracy, a variety of parallel
                 processing algorithms have been investigated due to the
                 recent availability of a number of commercial
                 multiprocessor machines. In this paper, research in the
                 field of parallel circuit simulation is surveyed and
                 the ongoing research in this area at the University of
                 Illinois is described. Both standard and
                 relaxation-based approaches are considered. In

                 the direct method approach, used in programs such as
                 SPICE2 and SLATE, and within the relaxation-based

                 Timing Analysis, and Waveform-Relaxation-Newton, are
                 described. The specific implementation issues addressed

                 multiprocessors with a shared-memory architecture
                 having a limited number of processors, although any of

                 analysis and some parallel execution techniques are
                 also examined. The major findings include: (1) Many
                 subscripts contain symbolic terms with unknown values.
                 A few methods to determine their values at compile time
                 are evaluated. (2) Arrays with coupled subscripts
                 appear quite frequently. It requires that all array
                 dimensions be handled simultaneously in a dependence
                 test, rather than just handling them separately as in
                 current test algorithms. (3) Nonzero coefficients of
                 loop indexes in most subscripts are found to be simple:
                 they are either 1 or -1. It allows an exact real-valued
                 test to be as accurate as an exact integer-valued test
                 for 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional arrays. (4)
                 Dependences with non-constant distance are found to be
                 rather common. This might have a significant impact on
                 current techniques of data synchronization, loop

                 algorithms on parallelism and vectorization for the
                 molecular dynamics package GROMOS. About 80\% of the
                 computing time (for the GROMOS benchmark) is spent on
                 the nonbonded interactions, and an important issue is
                 the method that is used for finding all pairs of atoms
                 (actually atom groups) which are within a given cutoff
                 radius of each other. Favored by the authors of GROMOS
                 is the use of the (Verlet) neighbor list. Substantial
                 restructuring of their code for the nonbonded
                 interactions has resulted in a speedup of 6.9 for the
                 8-processor Alliant FX/8 through the use of concurrent
                 subroutine calls. Vectorization gave a further
                 improvement of 30\%. However, the neighbor list
                 approach does not scale up linearly with the number of
                 atoms (nor would it be suitable if cutoffs were
                 abandoned in favor of such techniques as the fast
                 multipole method). Therefore an alternative subroutine
                 that implements the `gridcell plus linked list'
                 approach was also rewritten and tested. This resulted
                 in the discovery of an apparent flaw in an early study
                 of the relative merits of linked list gridcells versus
                 neighbor lists. It is observed that actually the
                 neighbor list approach is not much faster.",

                 processing. Conventional pipelining is still adopted to

                 performed on the general-purpose pipeline.

                 is used by many concurrent processes, some kind of

                 [2] [3]. The monitor guarantees that only one process

                 processes access the structure concurrently, they are
                 serialized by the monitor. In a large parallel computer

                 of sparse BLAS primitives on concurrent/vector
                 processors. Sparse computations are not only dependent
                 on the architecture, but also on the problem instance,
                 e.g., the structure of the sparsity pattern of a
                 matrix. This fact increases the complexity of sparse
                 matrix computations considerably. In fact no systematic
                 approach in implementing sparse codes for
                 concurrent/vector processors is proposed yet. In this
                 paper we layout a generic strategy for designing and
                 implementing sparse BLAS primitives on
                 concurrent/vector processors. The implementation of the
                 primitive sparse matrix times a number of dense vectors
                 will be handled in detail and essentially three
                 different implementations of this primitive will be

                 architecture and the problem instance. These trade offs

                 networks are analyzed in the literature, it is usually

                 enough to accommodate the entire message so that
                 switch-to-switch transfers can take place in one cycle.
                 In practice however, the channel width is constrained

                 on the choice of network topology and mandate more

                 analysis of issues pertaining to the performance and
                 reliability of direct connected multiprocessor
                 architectures. The hypercube structure is a direct
                 connected network of particular interest because of its
                 simplicity, symmetry, and connectivity. For this
                 reason, the first part of the thesis will focus on the
                 hypercube. Mathematical models, similar to those used
                 for multistage networks, will be developed to predict
                 the performance and reliability of the hypercube. The
                 results of these studies are of practical interest to
                 multiprocessor system architects considering a
                 hypercube interconnection structure. The remainder of
                 the thesis uses the hypercube as a standard for
                 measuring the potential of alternate topologies. First,
                 it examines two direct connection structures that have
                 been considered in the literature to be superior to the
                 hypercube. The results show that these alternate
                 networks fail to deliver the anticipated performance
                 improvements. Second, the thesis introduces a new
                 constraint into the performance analysis of networks
                 --- the width of the communication channel between
                 nodes. This study considers the various
                 cost-performance tradeoffs encountered when

                 in several ways to the compilation of programs.
                 Induction variables, the simplest form of recurrence,
                 are pivotal in loop optimizations and dependence
                 testing. Many recurrence relations, although expressed
                 sequentially by the programmer, lend themselves to
                 efficient vector or parallel computation. Despite the
                 importance of recurrences, vectorizing and
                 parallelizing compilers to date have recognized them
                 only in an ad-hoc fashion. In this paper we put forth a
                 systematic method for recognizing recurrence relations
                 automatically. Our method has two parts. First,
                 abstract interpretation [CC77, CC79] is used to
                 construct a map that associates each variable assigned
                 in a loop with a symbolic form (expression) of its
                 value. Second, the elements of this map are matched
                 with patterns that describe recurrence relations. The
                 scheme is easily extensible by the addition of
                 templates, and is able to recognize nested recurrences
                 by the propagation of the closed forms of recurrences
                 from inner loops. We present some applications of this
                 method and a proof of its correctness.",

                 previous methods result in programs whose control flow
                 graphs are reducible, programs normalized by our
                 technique satisfy a stronger condition than
                 reducibility, and are therefore simpler in their syntax
                 and structure than with previous methods. In
                 particular, all control flow cycles are normalized into
                 single-entry, single-exit while loops, and all goto's
                 are eliminated. Furthermore, the method avoids problems
                 of code replication that are characteristic of
                 node-splitting techniques. This restructuring obviates
                 the control dependence graph, since afterwards control
                 dependence relations are manifest in the syntax tree of
                 the program. In this paper we present transformations

                 direct effect on the reliability of the computer
                 system. Cray Research, Inc., designer and manufacturer
                 of large scale general purpose supercomputers, is
                 currently screening all Cray Y-MP modules for thermal
                 stress to increase the reliability of this product. The
                 requirements for thermal screening in our production
                 environment consisted of minimizing cost, decreasing
                 production time and maintenance, and providing a
                 testing procedure that would not require using highly
                 trained personnel. The commercially available equipment
                 evaluated did not meet all of these criteria. The
                 infrared (IR) scanning tester developed by Cray
                 Research provides accurate measurements of IC case
                 temperatures and automated analysis capabilities with a
                 minimum of operator intervention or evaluation. The
                 tester employs an Inframetrics Model 600 IR Imaging
                 Radiometer that is controlled by a personal computer
                 system and can be operated with a minimal amount of
                 training by any production worker. The computer also
                 controls and monitors various tester functions such as
                 cycling the power supplies and monitoring the current
                 draw of the module. The IR scanning capabilities
                 provided by this system have been an invaluable tool in
                 the production process. The IR scanning tester has also
                 been useful for performing various thermal experiments
                 throughout the company, as well as providing a thermal
                 record of each Cray YMP module produced. This paper
                 describes the design and operation of the IR scanning
                 tester and provides algorithms for remote operation of

                 similar domain decomposition strategy for hypercube
                 architectures. That strategy is to map sub-blocks, or
                 grains, of each array variable to the available nodes
                 in a manner that matches the hypercube topology to the
                 geometry of the underlying problem, maximizing locality
                 of reference and minimizing message passing overhead.
                 Each node then applies the same algorithm used in the
                 original sequential code to its subset of the data,
                 synchronizing with its neighbors as necessary. This
                 paper describes a domain decomposition tool that
                 accepts a sequential C program with comment directives
                 as input, and produces a new SPMD (Single Program
                 Multiple Data) C program which can be run on a

                 the local sub-block of an array, and to cause exchanges

                 in order to determine those instances of the loop-body
                 that can execute in parallel. The transformation we are
                 dealing with is the general wavefront method that
                 includes loop interchange, loop reversal, and loop
                 skewing as special cases. A nest of two loops with
                 constant loop limits is taken as the program model for
                 this paper; however, the transformation is not
                 restricted to this model. We study the transformation
                 of the nest into a new nest, caused by an arbitrary
                 unimodular matrix acting on the index variables.
                 Theorems and algorithms are presented dealing with the
                 questions that arise naturally: validity of such a
                 transformation, computation of loop limits of the new
                 nest, feasibility of parallel execution of the outer or
                 the inner loop of the transformed nest, existence of
                 matrices that allow such parallel execution,
                 identification of matrices that produce the well-known
                 loop transformations mentioned above, etc. This uniform

                 performance, especially for large-scale parallel
                 machines. This paper describes a hardware scheme for
                 supporting fast barrier synchronization. It allows
                 barrier synchronization to be performed within a single
                 instruction cycle for moderately sized systems, and is
                 scalable with logarithmic increase in synchronization
                 time. It supports a large number of concurrent
                 barriers, and can also be used to support a number of
                 different barrier synchronization schemes. Simulation
                 results show that under reasonable assumptions, this
                 hardware can decrease parallel loop execution time

                 computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of
                 large sparse matrices on a multiprocessor architecture.
                 We particularly consider the SVD of unstructured sparse
                 matrices in which the number of rows may be
                 substantially larger or smaller than the number of
                 columns. On vector machines, considerable progress has
                 been made over past 10 years in developing robust
                 algorithms for the solution of the sparse symmetric
                 eigenvalue problem using subspace iteration and the
                 Lanczos scheme, with or without a re-orthogonalization
                 strategy. Our intent is to extend and refine this
                 knowledge for computing the sparse singular value
                 decomposition on shared memory parallel computers. We
                 emphasize Lanczos, block-Lanczos, subspace iteration,
                 and the trace minimization methods for determining
                 several of the largest (or smallest) singular triplets
                 (singular values and corresponding
                 left-and-right-singular vectors) for sparse matrices.
                 The target architectures for implementations of such
                 methods include the Alliant FX/80 and the Cray-2S/4128.
                 This algorithmic research is particularly motivated by
                 recent information-retrieval techniques in which
                 high-rank approximations to large sparse term-document

                 linear systems are theoretically robust, converging for
                 systems with indefinite symmetric parts and arbitrarily
                 distributed eigenvalues. Slow convergence, however, has

                 level of concurrency and size of the created subtasks

                 (RP) methods for nonsymmetric linear systems are
                 presented and their properties described. One method is
                 based on Kaczmarz's method and has an iteration matrix
                 that is the product of orthogonal projectors; another
                 is based on Cimmino's method and has an iteration
                 matrix that is the sum of orthogonal projectors. A new
                 RP method which requires few matrix-vector operations,
                 explicitly reduces the problem size, is error reducing
                 in the 2- norm, and consistently produces better
                 solutions than other RP algorithms is also introduced.
                 Using comparisons with the method of conjugate gradient
                 applied to the normal equations, the properties of RP
                 methods are explained. A row partitioning approach is
                 described which yields parallel implementations
                 suitable for a wide range of computer architectures,
                 requires only a few vectors of extra storage, and
                 allows computing the necessary projections with small
                 errors. Numerical testing verifies the robustness of
                 this approach and shows that the resulting algorithms

                 the Perfect club benchmarks to evaluate performance. A
                 tool (MaxPar) determines the maximum available
                 parallelism in a program by instrumenting each program;
                 the results are computed by running the compiled
                 result. MaxPar can be used to set the standard against
                 which particular architecture simulations can be
                 compared. Three different parallel trace generators
                 convert benchmark programs into trace input files for
                 simulation. Parallel simulation kernels based upon
                 event-driven and hybrid time- and event-driven models
                 run on multiprocessors such as the Alliant FX/8. The
                 use of parallelism reduces the execution time.
                 Simulation components are designed in a high-level
                 language, and their modular design encourages a
                 `mix-and-match' philosophy of reconfiguring existing
                 components into new simulators to explore architectural
                 variations. A graphical user-interface provides a

                 parallel. We focus our attention on the systems whose
                 spectra contain some well separated large eigenvalues
                 since the performance of the CG algorithm is
                 particularly poor for solving such systems. Using this
                 new algorithm, we can choose a proper set of conjugate
                 subspaces to improve the performance of the CG
                 algorithm for solving the subproblems. Two versions of
                 the algorithm are proposed with respect to the choice
                 of the subspaces and can also be used to form
                 preconditioners to modify the spectrum of the given
                 system. The relation between the spectra of the given
                 system and its projections on the conjugate subspaces
                 is explored and it becomes a theoretical support to the
                 algorithm. The complexity of the algorithm has also
                 been studied in terms of the number of multiplications
                 required. A version of the algorithm for solving the
                 systems with a bordered block diagonal structure is
                 also proposed.",

                 run-time system for parallel execution of lisp programs
                 in the PARCEL environment. In particular, we present
                 practical techniques for task scheduling and dynamic
                 control of parallelism. PARCEL is a parallelizing
                 compiler which automatically restructures input
                 programs into parallelized codes, where most
                 parallelism is expressed in doall constructs. Due to
                 the characteristics of lisp programs, these doalls are
                 often nested dynamically. Several microtasking schemes
                 are discussed for the efficient execution of
                 dynamically nested doalls. A significant performance
                 degradation will result if every opportunity for
                 parallel execution is taken without considering the
                 limited processing capacity. We present methods based
                 on multiple-version of object codes for controlling the
                 growth of parallelism. The key to the success of these
                 methods is the decision when to switch from executing
                 parallel version to executing sequential version, and
                 vise versa. A framework is proposed for investigating
                 this problem and for comparing performance of different
                 control schemes. All of the schemes proposed have been
                 implemented in the PARCEL run-time system, and the

                 switch-stacks for implementing such support. We first
                 discuss current approaches to flat microtasking, and
                 investigate how to extend these for full microtasking.
                 We point out the problem of dummy waiting in the
                 processor that initiates a parallel loop. To solve this
                 problem, two schemes, dequeue-tasks and

                 disadvantages are discussed. The switch-stacks scheme
                 we proposed perfectly solves the problem. These schemes

                 solving the 3-D hydrodynamic equations describing the
                 sea's motion in any area of arbitrary geographical
                 extent. The method employs a finite difference grid in
                 the horizontal with a spectral approach through the
                 vertical. By this means a decomposition into equations
                 describing changes in the sea surface elevation,
                 (solved using a vectorizable explicit algorithm) and
                 equations describing vertical current structure is

                 factorization of general unsymmetric sparse matrices.
                 The algorithm, D2, is based on a new nondeterministic
                 parallel pivot search that finds a compatible pivot set
                 S of size m, followed by a parallel rank-m update.
                 These two steps alternate until switching to dense
                 matrix code or until the matrix is factored. The
                 algorithm is based on a shared-memory MIMD model and
                 takes advantage of both concurrency and
                 (gather-scatter) vectorization. The detection of
                 parallelism due to sparsity is based on Markowitz's
                 strategy, an unsymmetric ordering method. As a result,
                 D2 finds more potential parallelism for matrices with
                 highly asymmetric nonzero patterns than algorithms that
                 construct an elimination tree using a symmetric
                 ordering method (minimum degree or nested dissection,
                 for example) applied to the symmetric pattern of A +
                 A[superscript T] or A[superscript T]A. The pivot search
                 exploits more parallelism than previous algorithms that
                 are based on unsymmetric ordering methods. Possible
                 extensions to the D2 algorithm are discussed, including
                 the use of dense matrix kernels and a software
                 combining tree to enhance parallelsim in the pivot

                 expose their scalability. These networks are Cayley
                 graphs of noncommutative groups. They are of degree
                 four and are closely related to the k-ary 3-cubes of
                 comparable size. Supertoroidal networks have smaller
                 diameter and average diameter than k-ary 3- cubes,
                 thereby providing a design alternative which reduces
                 the pin complexity of wide data path interprocessor

                 elliptic partial differential equations on an
                 architecture with multiple levels of computational
                 parallelism and hierarchical memory organization. The
                 prototype system is the Cedar multicluster, developed
                 at the Center for Supercomputing Research and
                 Development (CSRD) at the University of Illinois. In
                 our experiments, each cluster of Cedar is a modified
                 Alliant FX/8 with four processors. The algorithms we
                 implement are parallel block cyclic reduction, and
                 certain domain decomposition methods based on the Schur
                 complement, for T-shaped regions. They are written to
                 exploit the multiple cluster capabilities of the
                 machine, as well as the concurrent and vector
                 computational resources of each cluster. For each of
                 these applications we obtain good multi-cluster
                 performance: good speedups are obtained for the new
                 implementations on multiple clusters of Cedar, relative
                 to the implementations best suited for a single
                 cluster. Most importantly, our experiments also point
                 to advantages of the multi-cluster organization. For
                 the case of block cyclic reduction, for example, the
                 performance using the new multicluster algorithm on

                 techniques for solving parabolic equations by the
                 method of lines. The main motivation for the proposed
                 approach is the possibility to exploit a high degree of
                 parallelism in a simple manner. The basic idea of the
                 method is to approximate the action of the evolution
                 operator on a given state vector by means of a
                 projection process onto a Krylov subspace. Thus, the
                 resulting approximation consists of applying an
                 evolution operator of very small dimension to a known
                 vector. This is in turn computed accurately by
                 exploiting well-known rational approximations to the
                 exponential. Since the rational approximation is only
                 applied to a small matrix, the only operations required
                 with the original large matrix are matrix by vector
                 products, and as a result the algorithm can easily by
                 parallelized and vectorized. Some relevant
                 approximation and stability issues are discussed. We
                 present numerical experiments with the method on a Cray
                 Y-MP and compare its performance with a few explicit
                 and implicit algorithms.",

                 to reduce large memory access times. It is necessary to
                 automatically manage such a hierarchy, to obtain
                 effective memory utilization. In this paper, we discuss
                 the various issues involved in obtaining an optimal
                 memory management strategy for a memory hierarchy. We
                 present an algorithm for finding the earliest point in
                 a program that a block of data can be prefetched. This
                 determination is based on the control and the data
                 dependences in the program. Such a method is an
                 integral part of more general memory management
                 algorithms. We demonstrate our method's potential by
                 using static analysis to estimate the performance
                 improvement afforded by our prefetching strategy and to
                 analyze the reference patterns in a set of Fortran
                 benchmarks. We also study the effectiveness of
                 prefetching in a realistic shared-memory system using
                 an RTL-level simulator and real codes. This differs

                 of the Boyer--Moore theorem prover [Gab85] using the
                 constructs of Multiplisp [Hal85] and Qlisp [GGS89],
                 with the automatic parallelization of the same program
                 using the Parcel compiler [Har89]. boyer is popular as
                 a Lisp benchmark because it performs a significant and
                 representative computation; its structure makes it
                 interesting for studying manual and automatic
                 parallelization as well. We will compare the
                 parallelism that results from a straightforward
                 hand-parallelization of the theorem prover using future
                 and qlet, with that introduced by Parcel. We find the
                 most significant parallelism within the theorem prover
                 is easily expressed using future or qlet, and that this
                 same parallelism is automatically uncovered by the
                 Parcel compiler. There is in boyer some
                 producer-consumer parallelism that can be expressed
                 using future or qlet, that is not exploited by Parcel.
                 On the other hand, we show that Parcel is able to
                 deduce the lifetimes of dynamically allocated objects,
                 and on this basis to guide the management of a
                 hierarchical memory, whereas there is no provision for
                 the management of such a memory in either Multilisp or

                 implementation of a cornerturn algorithm on that array.
                 For this application a cornerturn is defined as the
                 transpose of a bit matrix. In effect a matrix is
                 cornerturned by flipping it about its' [sic] major
                 axis. This cornerturn system transposes one or a stream
                 of n x m (where n,m [less than or equal to] 32)
                 matrices using the SPLASH hardware in a Sun
                 workstation. This cornerturn system consists of a Sun
                 workstation; SPLASH hardware (two cards) in the Sun
                 workstation; software that defines the cornerturn
                 configuration in SPLASH; and a driver written in C that
                 interfaces between the user and SPLASH. The system
                 performs 100 times faster than FORTRAN executing in a
                 Sun3 when the user sends a large array of 32 x 32 bit
                 matrices to be cornerturned. The system performs at 50
                 times faster than FORTRAN when given a small number of
                 matrices of degree less than 32 x 32.",

                 The Cedar machine is a reconfigurable, general-purpose
                 supercomputer that was designed and implemented at the
                 University of Illinois. A hierarchical circuit

                 hierarchical organization of Cedar. The new algorithm
                 and a number of key issues, such as multilevel circuit
                 partitioning, data partitioning, cluster algorithm
                 selection, and cluster algorithm implementation are

                 floating-point operations per second, or more, can be
                 produced in state-of-the-art MOS technologies. Such
                 computers will have tens of thousands of processors
                 interconnected by a network of bounded degree. Reducing
                 the required data motion through a careful choice of
                 data allocation and computational and routing
                 algorithms is critical for performance. The management
                 of thousands of processors can only be accomplished
                 through programming languages with suitable
                 abstractions. We use the Connection Machine as a model
                 architecture for future supercomputers, and Fortran 8X
                 as an example of a language with some of the
                 abstractions suitable for programming thousands of
                 processors. Some of the communication primitives
                 suitable for expressing structured scientific
                 computations are discussed, and their benefit with
                 respect to performance illustrated. With thousands of
                 processors engaged in the solution of a single
                 scientific problem, several subtasks are often treated
                 concurrently in addition to the concurrent execution of
                 each subtask. Some issues in constructing scientific
                 libraries for such environments are discussed.
                 Concurrent algorithms and performance data for matrix
                 multiplication and the Fast Fourier Transform are
                 presented. The solution of the compressible
                 Navier--Stokes equation in three spatial dimensions by
                 an explicit finite difference method, and the solution
                 of a parabolic approximation of the Helmholtz equation
                 by an implicit method are two examples of applications
                 for which data parallel implementations are described

                 Multiple Data stream) computers such as the Connection
                 Machine CM-2. The problem is cast as a dataflow graph,
                 using existing techniques for symbolic manipulation of

                 mapped to a `virtual dataflow machine' in such a way

                 large-scale shared memory multiprocessors is the
                 difficulty of efficiently maintaining cache coherence.
                 Proposed solutions to the coherence problem include
                 hardware directory schemes, which have very high memory
                 requirements, and software-directed schemes, which must
                 rely on imprecise compile-time memory disambiguation.
                 We propose a compiler-assisted directory mechanism that
                 uses a special cache of pointers in each memory module
                 to dynamically allocate pointers to blocks only as they
                 are referenced. This directory structure significantly
                 reduces the memory requirements of a hardware coherence
                 scheme. We also show how compiler marking of
                 shared-writable variables can further reduce its memory
                 requirements by not allocating pointers to memory
                 references that do not need them. Using trace-driven
                 simulations, we compare the memory requirements and the
                 performance of this approach to several of the
                 traditional directory schemes and to the
                 software-directed version control scheme. We find that
                 the performance of the proposed scheme is comparable to
                 that of the other coherence schemes, but with
                 significantly lower memory requirements.",

                 automatically extract parallelism from scientific
                 application programs. We find that the loop-level
                 parallelism of the multiprocessor performs better than
                 the instruction-level parallelism of the other
                 processors on programs with high inherent parallelism.
                 This performance difference is due to register
                 allocation difficulties and instruction look-ahead
                 requirements in the superscalar and pipelined
                 processors. The results suggest that dynamic loop
                 unrolling is inadequate for obtaining the best
                 performance in these processors and that it should be
                 done by the compiler to allow for more intelligent
                 register allocation. The multiprocessor is shown to

                 references, cache block sizes larger than a single word
                 can improve the memory performance of uniprocessors. In
                 shared memory multiprocessors, however, several studies
                 have suggested that the best memory performance comes
                 from small cache blocks due to the false sharing
                 effect. This result is unfortunate because larger cache
                 blocks can substantially reduce the memory requirements
                 of the cache coherence mechanism, and the prefetching
                 effect of the larger blocks could help hide the
                 unusually long latency to memory. Using trace-driven
                 simulations, we compare the memory performance of
                 different cache block sizes in a shared memory

                 gained by observing dynamic execution behavior.
                 Unfortunately, most high-performance machines provide
                 execution profile summaries as the only tool for
                 performance investigation. We have developed a tracing
                 library for the Cray X-MP and Cray 2 supercomputers
                 that supports the capture of execution events for
                 sequential and multitasked programs with minimal
                 overhead. This library has been extended with code that
                 utilizes the automatic Flowtrace and Perftrace
                 instrumentation on these machines allowing trace data
                 from routine entry and exit, and other program
                 segments, to be captured. To assess the utility of the
                 trace-based tools, three of the Perfect Benchmark codes
                 have been tested in scalar and vector modes with the
                 tracing instrumentation. In addition to computing
                 summary execution statistics from the traces and
                 comparing those to the standard Flowtrace and Perftrace
                 results, interesting execution dynamics appear when
                 studying the trace histories. It is also possible to
                 compare codes across the two architectures by
                 correlating the event traces. Our conclusion is that
                 additional tracing support in Cray supercomputers can
                 have significant returns in improved performance
                 characterization and evaluation.",

  abstract =     "In this thesis, feed-forward artificial neural
                 networks are applied to the problem of phoneme
                 recognition. `Simple' recognition problems are
                 investigated in order to discern the relationships
                 among the classification problem, the network
                 architecture, and the required amount of training data.
                 These experiments are discussed in light of the work of
                 Baum and Haussler and demonstrate the need for greater
                 understanding of the internal workings of this class of
                 networks. A method for combining small phoneme
                 classifiers analogous to that used in Waibel's work on
                 time-delay neural networks is discussed. Preliminary
                 investigation shows that the method reduces the
                 required computational time for problems involving many
                 phonemes; however, the technique demonstrates that
                 accurate phonetic descriptions are needed to build
                 knowledge-based phoneme recognition systems. Two sets
                 of distinctive features for phonemes are analyzed, and
                 the relationship between distinctive features and
                 network classification performance is investigated.
                 Complexity measures based on Cybenko's notion of
                 complexity theory are calculated for some two-phoneme
                 recognition problems, and an in-depth study of two
                 networks is presented.",

  abstract =     "Modern supercomputers like the CRAY Y-MP achieve their
                 high computing speed by using both vector and parallel
                 hardware. Autotasking, the new multitasking interface
                 on CRAY machines, supports an approach to parallelize
                 FORTRAN programs automatically. The autotasking concept
                 provides a user-friendly interface which can be used
                 efficiently for fine-grain parallelism and removes some
                 of the limitations which have restricted the usage of
                 multitasking in the past. This paper gives a short
                 introduction into the CRAY Y-MP system architecture and
                 the autotasking concept. The application of autotasking
                 to a program simulating the Czochralski bulk flow is
                 presented. It can be shown that after some code
                 modifications a speedup of nearly 6.5 on a CRAY
                 Y-MP8\slash 832 can be achieved, leading to a
                 performance of about 1200 Mflops.",

                 auto-scheduling, which brings together the control flow
                 and data flow models by combining most of the
                 advantages and excluding the major disadvantages of the
                 two familiar models. Auto-scheduling can be viewed
                 either as an abstract architectural model or as a
                 parallel program compilation framework. While in
                 ordinary environments parallel task creation and
                 scheduling is done by the operating system, or at best
                 the run-time library, in auto-scheduling task creation
                 and scheduling is performed by the user program itself,
                 making parallel processing affordable at
                 fine-granularity levels. Under auto-scheduling the
                 compiler does not only generate object code, but it
                 `lends' its knowledge about a program to the parallel
                 instruction threads of that program, allowing them to
                 manage, activate, and schedule themselves at run-time,
                 without the need of an external monitor. This is done
                 by means of special drive-code injected by the compiler
                 to each schedulable unit of a program (task, thread,
                 etc). We argue that auto-scheduling offers an optimal
                 approach for exploiting parallelism on real parallel
                 computer systems.",

  abstract =     "This paper describes a gate-level implementation of
                 the Associative Template Dataflow (ATD) Machine's
                 [3,4,5,6,7] Graph Coordinator. ATD is a dataflow
                 computer based on associative memory techniques, where
                 associative memory locations are grouped into
                 `templates' which control the program flow. The Graph
                 Coordinator contains the associative memory along with
                 the logic required to tie memory locations together
                 into `templates.' It also contains a broadcast
                 mechanism for the communications that drive the
                 templates and a scheduling mechanism that `fires'
                 templates when they are ready, causing an operation to
                 execute. The purpose of creating the gate-level
                 description of the Graph Coordinator was to estimate
                 the total logic required, the likely operating speed,
                 and the estimated power dissipation of a theoretical
                 Graph Coordinator chip. This information, in turn, can
                 drive further efforts to alter the ATD specifications
                 to enhance its buildability. This gate-level
                 description was built from logic components available
                 in LSI Logic's 10K library, which was considered a
                 representative logic family, and it was drawn and
                 simulated using Viewlogic software. The present design
                 resulted in a possible clock rate of 41.7 nanoseconds,
                 total logic of 500,000 gates, and power estimate of
                 17.2 watts. It is expected that more advanced logic
                 families currently available can reduce both the clock
                 rate and the power dissipation, and this paper suggests
                 some direction for future work.",

                 is do loops. When loop iterations of parallelized loops
                 are executed on multiprocessors, the cross-iteration
                 data dependences need to be enforced by synchronization
                 between processors. Existing data synchronization
                 schemes are either too simple to handle general nested
                 loop structures with non-trivial array subscript
                 functions or inefficient due to the large run-time
                 overhead. In this paper, we propose a new
                 synchronization scheme based on two data-oriented
                 synchronization instructions: synchread(x,s) and
                 synchwrite(x,s). We present the algorithm to compute
                 the ordering number, s, for each data access. Using our
                 scheme, a parallelizing compiler can parallelize a
                 general nested loop structure with complicated
                 cross-iteration data dependences. If the computations
                 of ordering numbers cannot be done at compile time, the
                 run-time overhead is smaller than the other existing

                 applications may be found that could benefit from the

                 imperative procedural programming methodology has not

                 method of programming the SDE in a procedural style

                 primitives and how those required by the dataflow model
                 can be synthesized from the available SDE operators.
                 Use of the dataflow model is motivated by its ability

                 time of basic blocks, instruction and operation issue
                 rates and issue stalls, and operation execution overlap

                 enhancing scalar performance in high-speed scientific
                 processors: software pipelining and loop unrolling. We
                 study the impact of the architecture (size of the
                 register file) and of the hardware (size of instruction
                 buffer) on the efficiency of loop unrolling. We also
                 develop a methodology for classifying software
                 pipelining techniques. For loop unrolling, a
                 straightforward scheduling algorithm is shown to
                 produce near-optimal results when not inhibited by
                 recurrences or memory hazards. Our study indicates that
                 the performance produced with a modified CRAY-1S scalar
                 architecture and a code scheduler utilizing loop
                 unrolling is comparable to the performance achieved by
                 the CRAY-1S with a vector unit and the CFT vectorizing
                 compiler.\par

                 Finally, we show that the combination of loop unrolling
                 and dynamic software pipelining, as implemented by a
                 decoupled computer, substantially outperforms the

                 computer architecture research for many years,
                 fundamental questions and trade-offs still remain
                 puzzling, not necessarily because of complexity but
                 because of the multitude of possible answers (e.g.,
                 shared vs. distributed memory, centralized vs.
                 distributed control, vector vs. scaler). This paper
                 addresses one such issue, namely heterogeneous vs.
                 homogeneous parallel machine organizations. Using
                 simple performance and cost models, we argue that
                 multiprocessors based on a fast global control unit
                 capable of fast execution of serial code, and capable
                 of managing an ensemble of slower processors, offer a
                 performance/cost ratio significantly better than any
                 comparable homogeneous multiprocessor with distributed
                 control. Although the issue of ``deliverable''
                 performance is an open question, it appears that such

                 new parallel algorithms for the eigenproblem with a
                 two-fold potential for parallelism. Specifically, we
                 explore the algorithmic implications of the fact that
                 an ability to compute nontrivial invariant subspaces of
                 a matrix M results in an ability to perform block

                 algorithms to compute nontrivial invariant subspaces of

                 primitives: matrix multiplication and solving systems

                 The hardware complexity of broadcast networks can be

                 is understanding the properties of turbulent flows. The
                 advent of large supercomputers permits the
                 investigation of turbulence with great accuracy in two
                 dimensions, but full three-dimensional problems are
                 physically more complex and their study is currently
                 limited to the case of simple flows. It is shown that
                 the availability of a continuous time-dependent
                 representation of the dynamics of fluid flows can
                 quickly lead to more complete understanding of the many
                 concurrent physical mechanisms ruling turbulence. Some
                 significant examples show how an analog videotape,
                 obtained from direct computer simulations of fluid
                 flows, suggests physical results that can later be
                 obtained through a mathematical analysis of the

                 Parameter-Adaptive Cost-Improving), a new adaptive
                 algorithm for iterative numerical problems, and its
                 application to the Stokes Problem, which gives rise to
                 an efficient adaptive Block-Gauss Seidel, or gasBGS
                 scheme. SPACI offers a powerful alternative to
                 iterative schemes whose convergence rate --- which is
                 not known a priori --- depends on some critical
                 parameter. By using information at successive iterates,
                 SPACI reevaluates the critical parameter and steers its
                 computation toward its optimal value, thus accelerating
                 the convergence of the underlying numerical scheme
                 towards a solution. The direct outcome is proportional
                 reduction in complexity, or execution time. In this
                 paper we also develop the `profile' of numerical
                 applications (which could be replaced by the adaptive
                 algorithm) in terms of specific conditions which need
                 to be satisfied. Experimental results for the case of
                 gasBGS indicate significant performance improvements
                 gained by SPACI over a well-known scheme. Analytical
                 models for predicting the performance improvement are
                 also developed in this paper. Finally, we discuss
                 possible extensions to the adaptive scheme and its

                 performance of the fast Fourier transform algorithm on
                 modern vector oriented supercomputers is presented. FFT
                 implementations based on these techniques are developed
                 for the CRAY-2 and the CRAY-YMP, and it is shown that
                 they achieve higher performance than previously
                 measured on these machines. The techniques include (1)
                 using gather/scatter operations to maintain optimum
                 length vectors throughout all stages of small to medium
                 sized FFTs, (2) efficient radix-8 and radix-16 inner
                 loops, which allow vector loads/stores to be overlapped
                 as much as possible and also reduce the arithmetic
                 operation count, and (3) prefetching twiddle factors as
                 vectors, so that on the CRAY-2 they can later be
                 fetched from local memory in parallel with common
                 memory accesses. Performance results for FORTRAN
                 implementations embodying these techniques demonstrate
                 that they are faster than CRAY's library FFT routine.
                 The actual speedups obtained are dependent on the size
                 of the FFT being computed and the supercomputer being
                 used and range from about 5 to over 300 percent.",

                 hardware that has the ability to execute many
                 instructions in parallel. In order for this potential
                 to be translated into the speedup of real programs, the
                 compiler must be able to schedule instructions so that
                 they can be overlapped without interlock delays and
                 resource conflicts. Previous work has shown that
                 prepass code scheduling helps to produce a better
                 schedule for scientific programs. But the importance of
                 prescheduling has never been demonstrated for
                 control-intensive non-numerical programs. These
                 programs are significantly different from the
                 scientific programs because they contain frequent
                 branches and they require global scheduling in order to
                 find enough independent instructions. In this paper,
                 the code scheduler of the IMPACT-I C compiler is
                 described and used to study the importance of prepass
                 code scheduling for a set of production C programs. It
                 is shown that, in contrast to the results previously
                 obtained for scientific programs, prescheduling is not
                 important for compiling control-intensive programs to
                 the current generation of superscalar and
                 superpipelined processors. However, if some of the
                 current restrictions on upward code motion are removed
                 in future architectures, prescheduling substantially
                 improves the execution time of this class of programs
                 on both superscalar and superpipelined processors.",

                 fundamental properties, and present a decomposition
                 method associated with W. The matrices W have the
                 relation W = e[superscript i theta]P*WP, i = [square
                 root of -1], [theta] [element of] R, where e is the

                 the property P[superscript k] = I, k [> or =] 1. The
                 superscript * denotes the conjugate transpose and I is
                 the identity matrix. We assume that k is finite and is
                 the smallest positive integer for which the relation
                 holds. The matrices W are referred to as circulative
                 matrices of degree [theta] with respect to P. Embedded
                 in this class of matrices are two special types of

                 anticirculative matrices, respectively, without
                 referring to their degrees for the sake of brevity.
                 After introducing these matrices and developing general
                 theories associated with them, we then discuss their
                 special cases and, in particular, define another two
                 special classes of matrices, to be referred to as
                 rotative and antirotative matrices, which are a special
                 case of the circulative/anticirculative matrices on one
                 hand and a generalization of (block)
                 circulant/anticirculant matrices on the other.

                 when there are consecutive writes from CPU to main
                 memory. Buffering is required for a cache in either
                 write-back mode or write-through mode, but it is more
                 important in the write-through mode because of a higher
                 write frequency. A write buffer of capacity four was
                 thought to provide most of the performance improvement
                 possible in a write-through cache. In this paper, a
                 trace-driven simulation on the SPARC machine is used to
                 re-evaluate write buffer performance, including the
                 read conflict effect. Results show that the read
                 conflicts do not produce a serious degradation, but
                 write stalls are still frequent when a slow main memory
                 is used, no matter what the capacity of the buffer is.
                 Two improved write buffer designs are studied: the
                 write-merging strategy, merging writes to the same
                 (line) address into one in the buffer, and the
                 write-back write buffer, reducing write traffic as in a
                 write-back cache. The results show that both designs
                 are effective in improving the performance without
                 excessive costs. The write-back write buffer has a
                 better performance, but the write buffer using
                 write-merging can still maintain the write-through
                 policy.",

                 great importance in the environmental sciences of
                 today. Realistic simulations impose great demands on
                 the existing computer systems, requiring the use of
                 considerable computational power and storage
                 capabilities. An implementation of an ocean general
                 circulation model on the Cedar multicluster
                 architecture is presented. This is based on the GFDL
                 three-dimensional model, that was adapted for
                 simulation of the Mediterranean. The model simulates
                 the basic aspects of large-scale, baroclinic ocean
                 circulation, including treatment of irregular bottom
                 topography. The data and computational mapping
                 strategies and the effect on the performance are
                 discussed. The Cedar version of the code, using four
                 clusters and 32 processors, has demonstrated
                 significant speedup compared to a single cluster and

                 embedding a hypercube of appropriate dimension in the
                 supertoroid. This paper presents the results of a study
                 of this problem on a sixty-four node supertoroidal
                 network. Our objective is to use the underlying group
                 theoretic structure of the network to influence the
                 search for efficient embeddings. Such a search is
                 ultimately directed by heuristics. Usually these
                 heuristics are graph theoretic, but heuristics are
                 developed in this paper which are group theoretic in
                 nature. It is conjectured that our approach can be used
                 to study the embedding problem when the host graph is
                 the Cayley graph of any group, in particular, wh;en
                 [sic] the host is an arbitrary supertoroidal network.
                 The work reported on in this paper is directly related
                 to other work conducted at SRC. The embeddings obtained
                 for the sixty-four node graph can be implemented on the
                 network testbed, H-Net, being developed at SRC. These
                 embeddings are also of interest because Duncan Buell
                 recently found embeddings of butterflies in
                 supertoroidal networks by an enlightened computer
                 search. A comparison of the results in this paper and
                 the results found by Buell are included.",

                 a[subscript n]x[subscript n] = 0. Since 1977 several
                 algorithms (with proofs) have been discovered to
                 recover the a[subscript i] given x. The most efficient
                 of these existing integer relation algorithms (in terms
                 of run time and the precision required of the input)
                 has the drawback of being very unstable numerically. It
                 often requires a numeric precision level in the
                 thousands of digits to reliably recover relations in
                 modest-sized test problems. We present here a new
                 algorithm for finding integer relations, which we have
                 named the `PSLQ' algorithm. It is proved in this paper
                 that the PSLQ algorithm terminates with a relation in a
                 number of iterations that is bounded by a polynomial in
                 n. Because this algorithm employs a numerically stable
                 matrix reduction procedure, it is free from the
                 numerical difficulties that plague other integer
                 relation algorithms. Furthermore, its stability admits
                 an efficient implementation with lower run times on
                 average than other algorithms currently in use.
                 Finally, this stability can be used to prove that
                 relation bounds obtained from computer runs using this
                 algorithm are numerically accurate.",

  abstract =     "Pin limitations are a fundamental obstacle in the
                 construction of massively parallel computers. In this
                 paper, we introduce a new class of d-dimensional bussed
                 hypercubes that can perform simultaneous bidirectional
                 communication across any dimension using only d + 1
                 ports per node, rather than the obvious 2d. Each
                 network is a hypergraph based on a tree T that
                 specifies the `shape' of the busses. By using various
                 trees for shapes, the d-dimensional bussed hypercube
                 Q[subscript d](T), derived from T, can be made to
                 perform d(d + 1)/2 node-to-node permutations. This
                 class of hypercubes is then shown to be a special case
                 of a general construction for a class of bussed
                 networks having d + 1 ports per node. For any node set
                 X, any sequence [formula] of permutations of X, and any
                 directed tree T, whose d edges are labeled with II, a
                 bussed network N (II,T) is constructed that can perform
                 every permutation arising from a path in T. Despite the
                 fact that each node has only d + 1 ports, each of the
                 O(dp2s) permutations is hard-wired into the network and
                 can be performed in one clock tick. This allows a node
                 of degree d + 1 to be adjacent to O(dp2s) other
                 nodes.",

                 barrel (cyclic) shifters of length n are known to exist

                 interconnection networks is examined using a recently
                 developed representation by directed 2-graphs that
                 captures purely topological properties, rather than
                 specific positioning of inputs, outputs, and switches,
                 thus allowing for easy identification of equivalent
                 networks. Networks on N = 2[superscript n] inputs are
                 considered, which are generalizations of the classical
                 shuffle-exchange network, by allowing an arbitrary
                 invertible linear operator T, over the finite field
                 GF(2), to replace the perfect shuffle and an arbitrary
                 non-zero translation v [to] v + gas to replace the
                 exchange operation. It is shown that a pair (T,gas)
                 gives rise to a universal network if and only if the
                 vectors gas, Tgas, Tp2gas,\ldots{}, T[superscript n -

                 any such pair is isomorphic to the de Bruijn graph on
                 N/2 nodes. Thus, a pair (T,gas) is either useless,
                 because its network is not connected, or it is as good
                 as the shuffle-exchange network. Constructive proofs
                 are given for the isomorphisms, and simple tests are
                 provided to identify universal (T,gas) pairs, based on
                 graph connectivity and the rational canonical form for
                 matrices. This provides a wide range of design

                 for the two transverse components of the magnetic

                 several computational advantages. In particular, by

                 enhance large grain parallelism in manner that
                 maintains reasonable stability. This is accomplished by
                 a combination of a novel reordering technique (H*) and
                 pivoting strategy. The large grain parallelism exposed
                 by the reordering is combined with medium (various
                 parallel row updates strategies) and fine grain
                 (vectorization) parallelism to allow adaptation to a
                 wide range of multiprocessor architectures.

                 this paper we formalize the concept of functional
                 parallelism through the notion of precedence in terms
                 of paths in graphs incorporating control and data
                 dependences. Precedences were also defined in [CS88] in

                 dependent on the ideas of parallel execution and time.
                 We show that the problem of determining precedences
                 statically is NP-complete. Determining precedence
                 relationship is useful in finding the essential data
                 dependences for synchronization purposes. We show that

                 data-parallelism) has been almost exclusively the main
                 target of parallelizing compilers. The variety of new
                 parallel architectures and recent progress in
                 interprocedural dependence analysis suggest new
                 directions for the exploitation of parallelism across
                 loop and procedure boundaries (or
                 functional-parallelism). This thesis studies the
                 problem of extracting functional parallelism from
                 sequential programs. It presents the Hierarchical Task
                 Graph (HTG) as an intermediate parallel program
                 representation which encapsulates data and control
                 dependences, and which can be used for the extraction
                 and exploitation of functional parallelism. Control and
                 data dependencies require synchronization between
                 tasks, and hence the problem of eliminating redundant
                 control and data dependences is important. We show that
                 determining precedence relationship is crucial in
                 finding the essential data dependences for
                 synchronization purposes, that there exists a unique
                 minimum set of essential data dependences, and that
                 finding this minimum set is NP-hard and NP-easy. We
                 present heuristic algorithms, which appear to work well
                 in practice, to find the minimum set of data
                 dependences. The control and data dependences are used
                 to derive execution conditions for tasks which maximize
                 functional parallelism. We discuss the issue of
                 optimization of such conditions and propose
                 optimization algorithms. The hierarchical nature of the
                 HTG facilitates efficient task-granularity control
                 during code generation, and thus applicability for a

  abstract =     "Floating-point arithmetic is considered as esoteric
                 subject by many people. This is rather surprising,
                 because floating-point is ubiquitous in computer
                 systems: Almost every language has a floating-point
                 datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have
                 floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be
                 called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from
                 time to time; and virtually every operating system must
                 respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow.
                 This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of
                 floating-point that have a direct impact on designers
                 of computer systems. It begins with background on
                 floating-point representation and rounding error,
                 continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point
                 standard, and concludes with examples of how computer
                 system builders can better support floating point.",

                 realistic shared-memory multiprocessor system that
                 utilizes Omega networks. A unique aspect is the
                 presence of bursts of requests, such as processors with
                 associated vector units or caches would generate. It is
                 demonstrated that the forward network, the memory
                 modules, and the reverse network of such a system
                 interact and affect each other's performance such that
                 good performance depends less on the speed of any one
                 component than on the interaction between them.
                 Cost-effective modifications for improving this balance
                 are evaluated. Within the range of system sizes studied
                 (32 to 512 processors), results show that MIN-based

                 flexibility of multiple inheritance without its
                 software engineering disadvantages. Rather than relying
                 on inheritance, our extension allows polymorphism to be
                 achieved by explicitly defining a signature (public

                 having to provide electronics which operates at the
                 aggregate bandwidth of the network by employing optical

                 compilers and other parallel programming tools, depend
                 solely on the accuracy and effectiveness of data
                 dependence analysis techniques. Although powerful
                 dependence analysis techniques exist and have been
                 employed in commercial and experimental systems, all
                 these schemes fail in the presence of symbolic terms
                 and pointers. In this paper we introduce a framework
                 for solving the dependence problem in the presence of
                 unknown symbolic terms. Our scheme, built on abstract
                 interpretation based on lattice theoretic models, and
                 classical dependence analysis, can be used to
                 accurately compute dependences in the presence of
                 symbolic terms, and can be extended to handle pointers.
                 Several examples of array references with symbolic
                 terms were extracted from common numerical packages,
                 and are discussed in this paper. We also gathered
                 statistics about the frequency of symbolic terms in
                 index expressions and loop upper bounds, which provide
                 an indication about the importance and usefulness of
                 symbolic dependence analysis schemes. The details of
                 implementation of symbolic dependence analysis in
                 Parafrase-2 [25] is also presented.",

                 significant performance degradation will result. In
                 this paper, the effects of controlling granularity and
                 the growth of parallelism at runtime in executing
                 automatically parallelized programs are addressed. Our
                 version-switch method allows the runtime system to
                 dynamically choose the appropriate version of codes for
                 execution in order to achieve better performance. The
                 decision when to switch version is shown to be critical
                 to the effectiveness of the method. A framework is
                 built to study how to estimate the current work load
                 for deciding when to switch versions. Four different

                 system wiring, have major impacts on the construction
                 and performance of large multiprocessor networks.
                 Packaging imposes a physical hierarchy on a
                 multiprocessor system. We examine ways to exploit this
                 hierarchy by grouping processors into clusters. We
                 combine previous analyses on clustering and wiring
                 constraints to compare the effects of packaging on the
                 performance of hierarchical and non-hierarchical system
                 organizations, focusing on clustered and flat
                 hypercubes. We find that clusters have better
                 performance than previously predicted. Under uniform
                 traffic, clustered hypercubes have lower saturation
                 loads than unclustered hypercubes, but substantially
                 better queueing performance prior to saturation. If a
                 significant proportion of traffic is directed to
                 processors within the same cluster, clustered systems
                 have comparable saturation loads and superior queueing
                 performance. Depending on the expected operating
                 environments, clustering is an attractive option when
                 packaging constraints are considered.",

  abstract =     "Circuit simulation has become an indispensable tool in
                 the design of very large scale integrated circuits
                 (VLSI). However, as integrated circuit technology
                 progresses, existing programs such as SPICE require
                 increasingly large amounts of time to simulate the
                 circuit being designed. Remedies for this problem were
                 observed in the development of relaxation-based
                 algorithms such as Iterated Timing Analysis (ITA) and
                 waveform relaxation (WR). Even these techniques, by
                 themselves, cannot keep up with the complexity of VLSI
                 circuits. The main objective of this thesis is to
                 explore the use of parallel processing techniques in
                 relaxation-based circuit simulation algorithms, with
                 the goal of minimizing the simulation time as much as
                 possible. Particular emphasis will be on parallel
                 variants of the Iterated Timing Analysis algorithm.
                 Detailed performance analysis and follow-up
                 enhancements are presented. The event-driven ITA
                 approach is shown to be the best algorithm based on the
                 research described here and the collection of benchmark
                 circuits used. Speedups as high as 6 were obtained on
                 eight processors using this approach.",

                 performance study of various parallel discrete event
                 simulation (PDES) methods on a centralized shared
                 memory machine (an Alliant FX-80). One of the most
                 important features of this implementation is that it
                 provides a single user interface for all the
                 implemented methods. These methods include the
                 Chandy-Misra paradigm with deadlock avoidance (using a
                 shared memory model), the Time Warp approach with
                 direct, aggressive and lazy cancellation, and a hybrid
                 approach, which exploits the parallelism available at
                 each point in simulated time. Two issues proved to be
                 significant in the efficient implementation of the
                 above methods: partitioning the tasks among the
                 available processors, and processor self-scheduling. In
                 this thesis, we examine various partitioning and
                 scheduling strategies and assess their impact on the
                 performance of the system. To study the performance of
                 the implemented simulation methods, we simulated two
                 kinds of systems: a synchronous multiprocessor machine
                 with an Omega interconnection network, and an
                 asynchronous toroid network where each node is a simple
                 first-come-first-serve server. The performance of the

                 problem in large-scale shared memory multiprocessors.
                 Hardware directory schemes have very high memory
                 requirements, while software-directed schemes must rely
                 on imprecise compile-time memory disambiguation.
                 Recently proposed dynamic directory schemes allocate
                 pointers to blocks only as they are referenced, which
                 significantly reduces their memory requirements, but
                 they still allocate pointers to blocks that do not need
                 them. We show how compiler marking can further reduce
                 the directory size by allocating pointers only when
                 necessary. Using trace-driven simulations, we find that
                 the performance of this new approach is comparable to

                 specialized techniques have been developed that in turn

                 the factorization of small supernodes is unrolled into
                 a directed acyclic graph. This graph can then be

                 The remaining, larger supernodes are then factored

                 kind of influence? [of Los Alamos on computer design]
                 One apparent in Stretch is that machine's noisy mode
                 facility (Los Alamos interviews). The inspiration of
                 these was Los Alamos Nicholas Metropolis, who in the
                 1950s developed what he called significance arithmetic:
                 the attempt to determine the consequences, for the
                 reliability of results, of errors caused by the need to
                 represent numbers by words of finite length. In noisy
                 mode the effects of truncation were handled differently
                 from in normal operation so as to allow errors caused
                 by truncation to be detected.

                 By definition of ordinary normalized [floating-point]
                 operations, numbers are frequently extended on the
                 right by attaching zeros. During addition the $n$-digit
                 operand that is not preshifted is extended with n
                 zeros, so as to provide the extra positions to which
                 the preshifted operand can be added. Any operand or
                 result that is shifted left to be normalized requires a
                 corresponding number of zeros to be shifted in at the
                 right. Both sets of zeros tend to produce numbers
                 smaller in absolute value than they would have been if
                 more digits had been carried. In the noisy mode these
                 numbers are simply extended with 1s instead of zeros
                 (1s in a binary machine, 9s in a decimal machine). Now
                 all numbers tend to be too large in absolute value. The
                 true value, if there had been no significance loss,
                 should lie between these two extremes. Hence, two runs,
                 one made without and one made with the noisy mode,
                 should show differences in result that indicate which
                 digits may have been affected by significance loss
                 (Buchholz 1962, p. 102).''",

                 variety of problems from areas including linear
                 programming problems, chemical engineering, fission
                 reactor seismic studies, and simulation studies of
                 computing systems. These systems are of the form Ax = b
                 where A and b are known and x is the unknown. Since the
                 systems are sparse, most of the values in A are zero.
                 Several techniques have been proposed to solve these
                 large sparse systems on parallel processors including
                 both direct solvers using Gaussian elimination and
                 iterative solvers. A key task which determines the
                 effectiveness of these techniques is the identification
                 and exploitation of computational granularity
                 appropriate for the target multiprocessor architecture.
                 In order for many of the algorithms to execute
                 efficiently the algorithms must assume special
                 properties of the systems such as symmetric positive

                 from which the system arises e.g., finite element
                 problems. These types of techniques are not guaranteed
                 to work well with general unsymmetric sparse systems. A

                 purposes. First, it gives a model of how individual

                 system I/O, allowing system designers to optimize I/O
                 hardware and file system algorithms to that model.
                 Second, the buffering simulations show what resources
                 are needed to maximize the CPU utilization of a
                 supercomputer given a very bursty I/O request rate. By
                 using read-ahead and write-behind in a large

  abstract =     "The San Diego Supercomputer Center is one of four NSF
                 sponsored national supercomputer centers. Up until
                 January of 1990, its workhorse was a Cray X-MP, which
                 served 2700 researchers from 170 institutions, spanning
                 44 states. In order to better understand how this
                 supercomputer was utilized by its diverse community of
                 users, we undertook a workload characterization study
                 of the Cray X-MP. The goals of our study were twofold.
                 First, we wished to characterize the workload at both
                 the functional and resource levels. The functional
                 level represents the user point of view: what types of
                 programs users are running on the system. The resource
                 level represents the system point of view: how the
                 systems resources (CPU, memory, I/O bandwidth) are
                 being used. Second, we wanted to see how the workload
                 changed over an average weekday. Thus, we conducted a
                 static characterization to understand its global
                 attributes over the entire measurement period, as well
                 as a dynamic workload characterization to understand
                 the time behavior of the workload over a weekday
                 cycle.",

  abstract =     "The training problem for feedforward neural networks
                 is nonlinear parameter estimation that can be solved by
                 a variety of optimization techniques. Much of the
                 literature on neural networks has focused on
                 backpropagation which is a variant of gradient descent.
                 The training of neural networks using backpropagation
                 is known to be a slow process with more sophisticated
                 techniques not always performing significantly better.
                 In this paper, we show that feedforward neural networks
                 can have ill-conditioned Hessians and that this
                 ill-conditioning can be quite common. The analysis and
                 experimental results in this paper lead to the
                 conclusion that many network training problems are
                 ill-conditioned and may not be solved more efficiently
                 by higher order optimization methods. While our
                 analyses are for completely connected networks, they
                 extend to networks with sparse connectivity as well.
                 Our results suggest that neural networks can have
                 considerable redundancy in parameterizing the function
                 space in a neighborhood of a local minimum,
                 independently of whether or not the solution has a
                 small residual.",

                 difficult to understand if there are complex (and
                 perhaps unknown) interactions among parameters. In such
                 situations, the scientist can turn to a process Tukey
                 has called exploratory data visualization. In
                 exploratory data visualization, we typically do not
                 know exactly what we are looking for; instead, we
                 explore the data with a variety of visualization
                 techniques that can help us understand the nature of
                 the data by demonstrating patterns in it. Given the
                 complexity of the data and the large number of ways to
                 map the data to a display, exploratory visualization
                 can be truly effective only if it can also be
                 interactive. In this paper we describe an experiment in
                 exploratory data visualization using a massively
                 parallel processor. With this approach we were able to
                 find new features in some of our oldest datasets and to
                 create more vivid presentations of familiar features in
                 these datasets. Our experience has also led us to a
                 better understanding of the nature of exploratory
                 visualization and has resulted in some formal
                 representation of the interaction process in this

                 been used to categorize a particular architecture in
                 which each instruction is broadcast to a large number
                 of processors. Each processor then executes that
                 instruction using data local to itself. However, the
                 SIMD concept can also be viewed as a model of
                 computation. In this paper, two different machine
                 architectures for supporting a SIMD programming model
                 with one-bit granularity are investigated. One machine,
                 the CM-2, is a bit-level parallel processor. The other
                 machine, the Cray-2, is a vector processor with
                 64-bit-wide functional units that is programmed to
                 support a bit-serial SIMD programming model.

                 Doacross execution assumed the uniform memory access
                 (UMA) architecture. In this paper, we propose a
                 Doacross execution scheme for the distributed shared
                 memory (DSM) architecture. Our scheme uses direct
                 communication and static message passing. Our
                 communication is direct because a producer writes (or
                 sends) data directly to the nearest shared memory
                 (NeSM) of its consumer. Our message passing is static
                 in the sense that a message is bound to a buffer
                 location determined at compile time. We present
                 compiler algorithms that transform a Doacross loop into
                 the proposed execution scheme and derive conditions
                 that can reduce the extra storage needed for message
                 buffers. The preliminary results show that the proposed
                 scheme can outperform approaches that ignore the
                 features of the DSM architecture, i.e. simply utilize
                 DSM architecture as UMA architecture.",

                 because it can have several useful properties including

                 applications from the PERFECT Club benchmark set, is
                 reported. Since the compiler plays a major role in
                 determining machine utilization and program execution
                 speed, the authors compile their benchmarks using the
                 state-of-the-art Cray Research production Fortran
                 compiler. They investigate instruction set usage,
                 operation execution counts, sizes of basic blocks in
                 the programs, and instruction issue rate. The
                 vectorized fraction of the dynamic program operation
                 count ranges from 4\% to 96\% for the benchmarks.
                 Instructions that move values between the scalar
                 registers and corresponding backup registers form a
                 significant fraction of the dynamic instruction count.
                 Basic blocks which are more than 100 instructions in
                 size are significant in number; both small and large
                 basic blocks are important from the point of view of
                 program performance. The instruction issue rate is less
                 than 0.5 instructions per clock cycle for each of the
                 benchmark programs, suggesting that the instruction
                 issue stage of the CRAY Y-MP is, on the average, not a

                 asynchronous waveform relaxation on parallel
                 processors. Three different approaches, all based on
                 event-driven scheduling techniques, are compared to the
                 standard data-flow scheme. Issues involving the use of
                 priority queues and preemptive scheduling are
                 described. Circuit examples are used to demonstrate
                 that good speedup can be achieved by using the
                 event-driven method. Our results indicate that the
                 combination of data-flow and event-driven scheduling,
                 together with a suitable preemptive scheme, provides a
                 speed improvement between 1.5 to 2.5 over standard

                 transformations, program analysis, and automatic
                 parallelization. While previous methods result in
                 programs whose control flowgraphs are reducible,
                 programs normalized by this technique satisfy a
                 stronger condition than reducibility and are therefore
                 simpler in their syntax and structure than with
                 previous methods. In particular, all control-flow
                 cycles are normalized into single-entry, single-exit
                 while loops, and all goto's are eliminated.
                 Furthermore, the method avoids problems of code
                 replication that are characteristic of node-splitting
                 techniques. This restructuring obviates the control
                 dependence graph, since afterwards control dependence
                 relations are manifest in the syntax tree of the
                 program. In this paper we present transformations that

                 interconnection network designs for shared memory
                 multiprocessors that provide unrestricted multicast and
                 notification capabilities. The networks allow efficient
                 synchronization and communication because they conserve
                 network bandwidth by eliminating polling and by
                 performing multicast to multiple recipient processors,
                 as opposed to broadcast or individual messages per
                 recipient processor. Simulation results show that the
                 use of these networks not only decreases
                 synchronization overhead, but also increases network
                 performance for non-synchronization traffic. The
                 hardware complexity of these schemes is reasonable,

  abstract =     "Debugging optimized code is a desirable capability not
                 provided by most current debuggers. Users are forced to
                 debug the unoptimized code when a bug occurs in the
                 optimized version. Current research offers partial
                 solutions for a small class of optimizations, but not a
                 unified approach that handles a wide range of
                 optimizations, such as the sophisticated optimizations
                 performed by supercomputer compilers. The trend with
                 current research is to make the effects of optimization
                 transparent, i.e., provide the same behavior as that of
                 the unoptimized program. We contend that this approach
                 is neither totally feasible nor entirely desirable.
                 Instead, we propose a new approach based on the premise
                 that one should be able to debug the optimized code.
                 This implies mapping the current state of execution
                 back to the original source, tracking the location of
                 variables, and mapping compiler-synthesized variables
                 back to user-defined induction variables. To aid the
                 user in understanding program behavior, various visual
                 means are provided, e.g., different forms of
                 highlighting and annotating of the source\slash
                 assembly code. While this unavoidably requires the user
                 to have a basic understanding of the optimizations
                 performed, it permits the user to see what is actually
                 happening, infer the optimizations performed, and
                 detect bugs. An example illustrates the effectiveness
                 of visual feedback. To support conventional debugger
                 functionality for optimized code, the compiler must
                 generate additional information. Current
                 compiler-debugger interfaces (CDIs) were neither
                 designed to handle this new information nor are they
                 extensible in a straight forward manner. Therefore, a
                 new CDI was designed that supports providing visual
                 feedback and the debugging of optimized code. This
                 paper specifies the details of a new CDI and relates
                 each feature back to the debugger functionality it
                 supports.",

                 introduced a quasi-minimal residual (QMR) version of

                 Bi-CGSTAB algorithm of Van der Vorst, which we call
                 QMRCGSTAB for solving nonsymmetric linear systems. The
                 motivation for both QMR variants is to obtain smoother
                 convergence behaviour of the underlying method. We
                 illustrate this by numerical experiments, which also
                 show that for problems on which Bi-CGSTAB performs
                 better than CGS, the same advantage carries over to
                 QMRCGSTAB.",

                 systems. Most software schemes assume a write-through
                 cache which keeps the cache and memory consistent but
                 generates a lot of write traffic. This causes processor
                 stalls, network and memory contention. Write-back

                 allowed to interact with each other through shared
                 variables. Existing compiler analysis and optimization
                 techniques for sequential programs must be carefully
                 examined before they can be safely applied to parallel
                 programs. In this paper, we present a general framework
                 for analyzing programs with cobegin parallelism, which
                 is based on state space exploration. Reducing the

                 employed which provide systematic methods for folding

                 encountered in SIMD architectures such as the

                 formulation of the first order solver, and the second
                 application is the parallel gradient evaluation of the

                 optimal control problem.",

                 computation of the eigenvalues of a symmetric
                 tridiagonal matrix T is proposed. Bisection is based on
                 the computation of the inertia of (T - [sigma]I) to
                 determine the number of eigenvalues of T less than
                 [sigma]. In order to introduce parallelism, the
                 proposed algorithm uses parallel matrix factorization
                 techniques to compute the diagonal D of the
                 LDL[superscript t] decomposition of P(T -
                 [sigma]I)P[superscript t], where P is a suitable
                 permutation matrix chosen to partially decouple the
                 factorization. This approach yields up to O(n)
                 parallelism for computing a single eigenvalue. The
                 resulting parallel algorithm has a sequential
                 computational complexity approximately 9/4 more
                 expensive than serial bisection; however, speedups of 5
                 to 6 over serial bisection and of 3.8 to 4.6 over
                 multi-section, due to the vectorization, have been
                 measured on the Cray 2 and YMP for a matrix of size
                 3000. For larger problems, YMP and Connection Machine 2

                 transform programs for parallel machines. Perhaps it is
                 even an interesting reference for experts. In addition,
                 this paper summarizes our experience with the
                 programming tools we used and discusses tools that
                 could have helped to increase the productivity of the
                 optimization process. This information is believed to
                 be a useful basis for future tool development
                 projects.",

                 techniques for solving parabolic equations by the
                 method of lines. The main motivation for the proposed
                 approach is the possibility of exploiting a high degree
                 of parallelism in a simple manner. The basic idea of
                 the method is to approximate the action of the
                 evolution operator on a given state vector by means of
                 a projection process onto a Krylov subspace. Thus, the
                 resulting approximation consists of applying an
                 evolution operator of very small dimension to a known
                 vector which is, in turn, computed accurately by
                 exploiting high-order rational Chebyshev and Pade
                 approximations to the exponential. Because the rational
                 approximation is only applied to a small matrix, the
                 only operations required with the original large matrix
                 are matrix-by-vector multiplications, and as a result
                 the algorithm can easily be parallelized and
                 vectorized. Further parallelism is introduced by
                 expanding the rational approximations into partial
                 fractions. Some relevant approximation and stability
                 issues are discussed. We present some numerical
                 experiments with the method and compare its performance
                 with a few explicit and implicit algorithms.",

                 understanding of applications and their intelligent
                 scheduling within the system. In this paper we present
                 a general management framework for the DHSS, by
                 introducing an application characterization technique,
                 called Code Flow Graph (CFG) and Code Interaction Graph
                 (CIG). These models are based on code profiling and
                 analytical benchmarking and provide a detailed
                 architectural dependent characterization of DHSS
                 applications. A general cost function is presented that
                 is based on the execution and I/O overheads associated
                 with applications. An optimal scheduler tries to
                 minimize this cost; the design of which is an

                 systems requires the effective use of parallelism in
                 many forms and at numerous levels. This survey article
                 discusses program analysis and restructuring techniques
                 that target parallel architectures. We first describe
                 various categories of architectures that are oriented
                 toward parallel computation models: vector
                 architectures, shared memory multiprocessors, massively
                 parallel machines, message-passing architectures,
                 VLIWs, and multithreaded architectures. We then
                 describe a variety of optimization techniques that can
                 be applied to sequential programs to effectively
                 utilize the vector and parallel processing units. After
                 an overview of basic dependence analysis, we present
                 restructuring transformations on DO loops targeted both
                 to vectorization and to concurrent execution,
                 interprocedural and pointer analysis, task scheduling,
                 instruction level parallelization, and
                 compiler-assisted data placement. We conclude that
                 although tremendous advances have been made in
                 dependence theory and in the development of a `toolkit'
                 of transformations, parallel systems are used most
                 effectively when the programmer interacts in the

                 harnessing the potential of high-performance,
                 hierarchical-memory systems, especially vector and
                 parallel systems. In the numerical applications
                 typically executed on such systems, a significant
                 portion of global memory data traffic and, hence,
                 memory system delays arise from accesses to blocks of
                 array elements. These delays can be reduced by using
                 compile-time information to detect when global read and
                 write accesses are redundant (unnecessary) and can be
                 replaced by accesses to local data copies or eliminated
                 entirely. Eliminating a redundant access can speed up
                 program execution in two ways; first, the slow global
                 memory access is replaced by a faster local access.
                 Second, the time to perform other global memory
                 accesses may be reduced as a result of the decreased
                 traffic level and, hence, contention. In a previous
                 paper, we introduced the notion of redundancy analysis.
                 In this paper, we develop our terminology more fully.
                 We also detail our compile time algorithm for applying
                 combined flow and dependence analysis to sequential and
                 parallel programs to detect redundancies across loop
                 nests and in the presence of conditionals. Furthermore,

                 redundancies.",

  abstract =     "Memory access delays are a key factor limiting the
                 performance of large-scale, shared-memory
                 multiprocessors. To alleviate this problem, memory
                 hierarchies and asynchronous block transfer mechanisms
                 are often incorporated into such systems. However, for
                 these two mechanisms to be of assistance, they must be
                 managed effectively, either in hardware or in software.
                 Consequently, there are several levels at which the
                 problem of reducing memory access delays can be
                 attacked. The first is to improve the performance of
                 the shared-memory system itself, where the memory
                 system implicitly includes both the network and the
                 memory modules themselves. The second is to develop
                 techniques to manage the memory hierarchy effectively
                 and to make use of the block transfer mechanisms. This
                 thesis addresses this problem at both of these levels.
                 The first part examines the behavior of a realistic,
                 shared-memory system and evaluates cost-effective,
                 hardware modifications for improving performance. An
                 additional goal is to achieve memory system
                 scalability, where the term scalable describes systems
                 whose per-processor performance is roughly constant
                 across the range of system sizes examined. The effects
                 of data prefetching on network and overall program
                 performance are also studied. The remainder of this
                 thesis addresses the problem of improving utilization
                 of local storage in shared-memory systems where, at the
                 very least, each processor has access to local
                 (private) storage in addition to the global (shared)
                 memory. The emphasis of this research is on optimizing
                 numerical programs, that consist largely [sic] array
                 data accesses. When targeting the optimization of such
                 accesses, classical flow and dependence analysis
                 techniques do not suffice. Therefore, a combined
                 flow-and-dependence analysis method is developed to
                 produce analytical information needed to optimize these
                 accesses. This is the first such technique developed
                 for parallel programs. It is sufficiently general to be
                 used to detect prefetching opportunities, redundant
                 (unnecessary) global reads and writes, and potentially
                 stale accesses. Such cases can be detected across loop
                 nests and parallel epochs, and in the presence of
                 conditionals. This combined flow and dependence
                 analysis technique is used as part of an integrated
                 hardware/software approach for eliminating redundant
                 memory accesses and prefetching data. To capitalize on
                 information obtained at compile time, a new local
                 storage facility the Priority Data Cache (PDC) is
                 proposed. It is intended to capitalize on both spatial
                 and temporal locality, whether detected at compile time
                 or at run time. Whereas alternative local storage
                 facilities, e.g., caches and local memories, were
                 originally designed for classical uniprocessor systems,
                 the PDC is especially designed for vector and parallel
                 environments as well.",

                 parallelizing compilers. Within this framework,
                 symbolic analysis is used as an abstract interpretation
                 technique to solve many of the flow analysis problems
                 in a unified way. Some of these problems are constant
                 propagation, global forward substitution, detection of
                 loop invariant computations, and induction variable
                 substitution. The solution space of the above problems
                 is much larger than that handled by existing compiler
                 technology. It covers many of the cases in benchmark
                 codes that other parallelizing compilers can not
                 handle. Employing finite difference methods, the
                 symbolic analyzer derives a functional representation
                 of programs, which is used in dependence analysis. A
                 systematic method for generalized strength reduction
                 based on this representation is also presented. This
                 results in an effective scheme for exploitation of
                 parallelism and optimization of the code. Symbolic
                 analysis also serves as a basis for other code

                 Nevertheless, programming parallel systems is still a
                 poorly understood art. With the availability of
                 traditional vector processors such as Cray and Convex
                 systems in multi-headed versions, tools for exploiting
                 the available tightly coupled MIMD parallelism become
                 very important. Frequently, the effectiveness of tools
                 depends greatly on the application area; as a general
                 rule, automatic parallelization tools may do well in
                 certain situations but badly in others. This paper
                 reports on a performance study of Cray's Autotasking
                 for the Y-MP\slash 4for certain seismic codes;
                 specifically the algorithm involved was 3D DMO. The
                 experimental set up was as follows: Code that
                 previously had been carefully handcoded for a
                 four-processor X-MP was stripped of all parallelization
                 directives (micro and macro tasking) and the resulting
                 uniprocessor code was submitted to Autotasking. The
                 results are encouraging in that the parallelism
                 achieved by the autotasked programs compares very
                 favorably with that of the original handcoded
                 programs.",

  abstract =     "In this thesis, we consider the numerical solution of
                 four kinds of linear systems: saddle-point problems,
                 Stokes problems, symmetric systems (positive definite
                 or indefinite), and unsymmetric systems. These systems
                 are related, and all of them arise from the numerical
                 solution of partial differential equations. For
                 saddle-point problems, we introduce a class of
                 expansion methods based on a new solution
                 representation of the general problem. Many difficult
                 computations involved in Uzawa and projection type
                 methods for saddle-point problems are avoided in our
                 approach. For the Stokes problems, by introducing a new
                 variable, we split the linear system into several
                 smaller systems according to its sparse structure. This
                 new variable is then updated so that the split systems
                 eventually produce the solution of the original
                 problem. For symmetric systems that are indefinite and
                 do not have a special sparse structure like
                 saddle-point problems, we propose a class of nested
                 iterative methods to handle them. We study how the
                 convergence rate of the outer iteration is related to
                 the convergence rate of the inner iterations. For
                 symmetric positive definite systems, we propose a class
                 of nested preconditioners and analyze properties of
                 these preconditioners. Some necessary and sufficient
                 conditions for the optimality of these nested
                 preconditioners are established. Finally, for
                 unsymmetric systems, we generalize the concept of
                 spectral equivalence for symmetric positive definite
                 systems to these general systems. We also study some
                 properties of spectrally equivalent matrices and
                 consider their applications for constructing efficient
                 iterative methods.",

                 Atmospheric Research (NCAR) migrates large numbers of
                 files to and from its mass storage system (MSS) because
                 there is insufficient space to store them on the Cray
                 supercomputer's local disks. This paper presents an
                 analysis of file migration data collected over two
                 years. The analysis shows that requests to the MSS are
                 periodic, with one day and one week periods. Read
                 requests to the MSS account for the majority of the
                 periodicity; as write requests are relatively constant
                 over the course of a week. Additionally, reads show a
                 far greater fluctuation than writes over a day and week
                 since reads are driven by human users while writes are
                 machine-driven.",

                 higher bandwidth of communication, accommodating the
                 needs of current high-performance processors, including
                 those with multiple memory ports. We also obtain a very
                 scalable system, by defining a processor-switch-memory
                 building block, that can be used in systems with
                 processor count in the range of a few units to several
                 thousands. The performance evaluation of multiple Omega
                 networks is done through a simple analytical model that
                 allows us to compare their performance to a [sic] that
                 of a single network, and investigate alternatives for
                 processors with multiple memory ports. The results show
                 that the performance (in terms of bandwidth and latency
                 of communication) of systems with multiple networks is
                 more stable with respect to variations in systems

                 be deterministic, both in their final results and
                 intermediate states. However, debugging such programs
                 requires a mechanism for locating race conditions or
                 violations of the intended determinacy when they occur.
                 This paper answers a previously open question by
                 presenting the first precise, efficient algorithm for
                 dynamically detecting race conditions in programs that
                 use non-trivial synchronization. We address Post/Wait
                 synchronization, the most powerful type of
                 synchronization for which efficient race detection is
                 possible. Our algorithm computes the order in which
                 synchronization operations in the execution are
                 guaranteed to have occurred. Using this information
                 race conditions can be detected either post-mortem or
                 on-the-fly. Previous work has addressed either simpler
                 types of synchronization, approximations to race
                 detection, or a different (and easier to detect) type
                 of race.",

                 `91 Cray Research introduced its new top of the line

                 2Gbytes (256 Mwords) of central memory, and a new
                 dual-vector pipeline architecture, the system offers
                 peak performance of 16 Gflops, and unequalled sustained
                 `real world' performance. The first completed system
                 was on-line at the Supercomputing '91, and delivered to
                 the customer in February 1992. In this paper, results

                 to the random vortex method of computational fluid
                 dynamics. Although the computational cost is high, the
                 method has the desirable features of being grid free
                 and of automatically adapting to the solution by
                 concentrating elements where the gradient is large. In
                 addition, the method can be extended easily to more
                 than two space dimensions. A key feature of the method
                 is discretization in terms of the dependent, rather
                 than independent, variable, giving it features in
                 common with Lagrangian particle methods. We derive the

                 arbitrary rectangular matrix of order $n \times s$ with
                 $4s$ of moderate size. The method uses a single Krylov

                 switched networks called deflection routing. In
                 deflection routing, an attempt is made to assign each
                 message at a switch node to an output port that moves
                 the message closer to its destination. If it is
                 impossible for all messages to acquire an advantageous
                 output port, then some messages are deflected out ports
                 that may move them farther from their destination. Two
                 analytic models are developed to predict deflection
                 performance as a function of network topology and
                 offered load. One model allows for the accurate
                 prediction of a number of network performance
                 statistics. The other model is used to develop a bound
                 relating average latency and throughput to the degree
                 and average distance of the underlying topology. Under
                 the assumptions given for the model, deflection routing
                 is shown to be within a constant factor of optimal with
                 respect to average latency and throughput. Furthermore,
                 the model suggests a graph theoretic conjecture
                 relating the bisection width of a network to its degree
                 and average distance.",

  abstract =     "One way to combine the powers of symbolic computing
                 with numeric computing is to automatically derive and
                 produce numeric code. This approach has important
                 applications in science and engineering. Once the
                 desired formulas and procedures are derived in a
                 symbolic manipulation system, they can be translated
                 into a target numeric language by a {\em code
                 generator}. GENCRAY is a code generator written in the
                 C language for portability. GENCRAY defines a
                 LISP-style input language that is translated into
                 either FORTRAN 77 or CRAY FORTRAN. By defining its own
                 input syntax, GENCRAY becomes a free-standing code
                 translator that can be made to work with any symbolic
                 manipulation system. GENCRAY is portable to any
                 computer system with a standard C compiler. Input to
                 GENCRAY can come from a file or directly from a
                 symbolic system through a pipe. On UNIX systems with
                 Berkeley networking, GENCRAY also runs as a network
                 server. The input syntax is customizable to allow both
                 Common and Franz LISP input styles. In addition to
                 generating easily vectorizable CRAY FORTRAN code,
                 GENCRAY also provides high-level, easy-to-use parallel
                 programming macros to produce parallel code for the
                 multiprocessor CRAY systems. The features,
                 applications, usage, and implementation of GENCRAY are
                 described. Techniques for producing parallel codes are
                 discussed and illustrated by a substantial example

                 An algorithm is presented that generates a visibility
                 ordering of an acyclic convex set of meshed convex
                 polyhedra. This algorithm takes time linear in the size

                 nonconvex cells, nonconvex meshes (meshes with cavities
                 and/or voids), meshes with cycles, and sets of
                 disconnected meshes to be ordered. Visibility ordering
                 of polyhedra is applicable to scientific visualization,

  abstract =     "Linear systems with large sparse nonsymmetric matrices
                 arise in many applications. It is therefore important
                 to be able to solve them rapidly and efficiently.
                 Whereas the solution of symmetric positive definite
                 systems has been extensively explored, and many fast
                 and stable solvers have been developed, there still is
                 a large need for reliable iterative solvers for
                 nonsymmetric indefinite systems. The solvers developed
                 to date are either slow converging or converge only for
                 very special cases. Often, it is hard or impossible to
                 predict whether the solver will converge at all and if
                 it delivers correct results in case of convergence when
                 attempting to solve a specific problem. This paper
                 investigates some preconditioned conjugate
                 gradient-like algorithms which can be implemented
                 easily and in some cases show superior convergence.
                 However, thay lack robustness. The algorithms have been
                 implemented and applied to a variety of test problems.
                 The results are presented here.",

                 for programs written in these high-level languages. The

                 logic and fault simulation, developed for and
                 implemented on the Cray Y-MP supercomputer, a general
                 purpose shared-memory parallel machine with vector
                 processors. The parallel-and-vector version of the
                 event-driven logic simulation algorithm achieves a
                 speedup of 52 on the Cray Y-MP with 8 processors, with
                 a maximum performance of about 2 million events per
                 second. These results are comparable to the performance
                 of hardware simulation engines and can be implemented
                 on other parallel machines without major modifications.
                 The second algorithm is a parallel and vector version
                 of the parallel fault simulation algorithm.
                 Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that
                 very high evaluation rates (20 to 32\$MUL@10${}^9$
                 evaluations/s.) can be achieved. Speedup factors of 45
                 to 69 are observed between the scalar and the parallel
                 and vector execution of the fault simulator.",

                 a harness for coordinating the divide-and-conquer

                 nested data structures as well as nested data-parallel

                 simple programming model and portability. The current
                 NESL implementation is based on an intermediate
                 language called VCODE and a library of vector routines
                 called CVL. It runs on the Connection Machine CM-2, the

                 important characteristics central to many applications
                 are exploited through the use of shared-memory
                 programming techniques using existing compiler
                 technology. A cluster-capable 84-processor system, the
                 CRAY APP provides a flat shared memory, low memory
                 latency, fast barrier synchronization, and
                 hardware-assisted parallel support. A patented
                 crossbar\slash bus architecture provides system
                 economy. Deterministic system behavior allows the
                 compilers to view the system as a single virtual
                 processor. For even higher performance, multiple CRAY
                 APPs can be clustered. Cluster configurations may also
                 contain a globally accessible memory. High bandwidth
                 low latency connections allow this configuration to be
                 effective for applications that require more

                 for vector operations within a logically separate data
                 space. The first target for the AC compiler is a single
                 node (SPARC plus vector units) of Thinking Machine
                 Corporation's CM-5. The AC compiler is based on the GNU
                 C compiler (GCC) and performs all of the GCC
                 optimizations. Straightforward extensions of GCC's
                 register definitions to include vector registers and of
                 its expression evaluator to accommodate data movement
                 between the separate data spaces have produced
                 surprisingly good performance. AC enables programmers
                 who know how the CM-5 hardware works to program a node
                 of the machine effectively in C without resorting to
                 assembly language. AC also provides the usual
                 advantages of C without requiring the overhead
                 generally associated with high-level programming
                 models. As an `intermediate-level' language, AC can be
                 used to program high-performance subroutines that can
                 be called directly from high-level languages and
                 indirectly through libraries that may implement a
                 high-level programming model.",

                 supercomputers CRAY X-MP machines allow simultaneous
                 vector streams to compete among each other to obtain
                 memory resources. The resulting memory conflicts are
                 resolved by the memory system using a conflict
                 resolution algorithm during runtime. In [3], a class of
                 conflicts called linked conflicts has been identified
                 as a significant factor that influences the steady
                 state performance of CRAY X-MP memory system. This
                 paper proposes a simple modification to the original
                 conflict resolution mechanism to avoid such steady
                 state conflicts. We show that it is possible to avoid
                 linked conflicts due to concurrent vector accesses by a
                 single CPU with the proposed conflict resolution
                 scheme. Some examples are presented to show the
                 proposed scheme prevents these linked conflicts.",

                 an experimental SIMD machine. dbC's contribution is

                 abstraction of the data parallel programming model,
                 hiding implementation-dependent features, so that the
                 high level dbC program can be ported without change
                 among several diverse architectures. Second, dbC
                 exposes in the high level language the full bit-serial
                 processing capabilities of many SIMD arrays, making
                 possible the efficient implementation of both

                 typically evaluated by deriving metrics such as
                 throughput and latency as functions of synthetic
                 communication patterns. This evaluation ignores the
                 complex temporal interactions between the application,
                 processors, and network that arise when executing
                 parallel applications. This paper investigates adaptive
                 and non-adaptive routing algorithms in an environment
                 that preserves such interactions. The investigation is
                 conducted by executing a parallel application, sample
                 sort, on an experimental parallel machine, Hnet. The
                 network architecture of Hnet can be varied without
                 affecting any other aspect of the machine. Using the
                 sample sort algorithm on Hnet, we show that while
                 adaptive routing can sometimes realize its promise of
                 higher network throughput, it can also perform
                 significantly worse than non-adaptive routing.",

                 is in the application of these techniques to large

                 these structures, however, the sequential computer's

                 the recent existence and rapid development of

                 large-scale structural optimization problems is

                 balancing in the costly early stages of the algorithm
                 is accomplished without redistribution of data between
                 stages through the use of the block scattered
                 decomposition. Computation of the invariant subspaces

  abstract =     "The CRAY APP is a highly parallel network compute
                 server designed to accelerate Fortran and C programs in
                 a UNIX environment. It can run complete programs in a
                 simple shared memory environment, including support for
                 UNIX systems calls. A very efficient HiPPI interface
                 makes the CRAY APP cluster-capable and well-suited to
                 interact with other programs running on a network in a
                 client\slash server mode. Several novel features of the
                 CRAY APP system design and programming environment
                 allow for simple porting and incremental tuning of
                 existing applications. These include a highly efficient
                 microkernel operating system, low overhead
                 library-based parallel support software, and a simple
                 refinement to existing vectorization techniques called
                 data vectorization. This paper discusses parallel
                 programming on the CRAY APP, the system features that
                 make the programming environment possible, and some
                 examples of complete applications that have sustained
                 over 1 GFLOP on the CRAY APP.",

  abstract =     "This paper proposes a flexible, reprogrammable
                 hardware solution to the acceleration of text-based
                 keyword search problems. In these problems, a stream of
                 input text is checked against a known list of keywords
                 (a dictionary) for occurrences of those keywords in the
                 text. Our solution employs an attached processor called
                 Splash 2, which exploits the speed and
                 reconfigurability of Field Programmable Gate Array
                 technology. The Splash 2 system was designed and built
                 at the SRC for a wide variety of applications. A Splash
                 2 system is comprised of an interface board to a Sun
                 Sparc-2 host and up to 16 Splash boards, each of which
                 contains 16 Xilinx 4010 FPGAs interconnected in a
                 linear array and also through a 16-way full crossbar
                 switch. Each Xilinx chip is coupled with a 4 Mbit
                 static RAM through a dedicated interface. The text
                 searching program implemented on a one-board Splash 2
                 system is capable of processing text at an estimated
                 rate of 50 million characters per second.",

                 of the machine (or network) would use to develop
                 efficient programs. An adl `program' is a description
                 of an architecture's characteristics rather than an
                 executable procedure. adl's syntax is responsible for
                 little more than the structure of a machine
                 description. The details of the description are
                 contained in the semantics of the language constructs.
                 This document presents adl's syntax and semantics and
                 describes how to use the adl system.",

                 interest is an algorithm for multiplying matrices by

                 matrix elements. Two blocked implementations also are

                 be small relative to the size of the matrices. Results
                 from tests performed on a Cray-2, Cray Y-MP, and

  abstract =     "This thesis considers the design of perfect
                 reconstruction filter banks (PRFBs) for adaptive
                 filtering and coding applications. The first half of
                 this thesis derives a generalization to the Transform
                 Domain Adaptive Filter (TDAF), which uses filter banks
                 instead of unitary transforms to preprocess input
                 signals. The parametrization for a class of
                 nonparaunitary PRFBs is derived and used to express the
                 minimum mean square error (MMSE) of the Generalized
                 Transform Domain Adaptive Filters, in terms of the
                 filter bank chosen. Using this parametrization, it is
                 shown how to analytically design filter banks to give
                 optimum error and convergence performances given prior
                 knowledge of the adaptive application. Design examples
                 demonstrate the improved error performance of the
                 derived structures relative to the Least Mean Square
                 (LMS) algorithm when prior knowledge is incorporated.
                 The second half of this thesis compares the energy
                 compacting properties of unitary filters from transform
                 coders and paraunitary filters from subband coders
                 using a cost criterion which is proposed. Stationary
                 processes for which paraunitary filters have better
                 energy compaction than unitary filters are denoted as
                 subband optimal, and all subband optimal processes are
                 analytically characterized for the case of length-4
                 filters. It is shown analytically for length-4 filters
                 and empirically for longer length filters that Markov-1
                 processes are subband optimal and that the Daubechies
                 maximally smooth wavelet sequences achieve better
                 energy compaction than the best unitary filters for
                 Markov-1 inputs. A class of processes which is subband
                 optimal for longer filter lengths is shown to have
                 autocovariance matrices with a particular
                 eigenstructure. Sample autocovariance matrices from
                 images are shown to exhibit this structure and are also
                 shown to be subband optimal.",

                 Atmospheric Research (NCAR) May 24, 1993. The system

                 GaAs and packaging will be taken advantage of, allowing
                 us to move rapidly to the CRAY-4 system. The CRAY-4

  abstract =     "In this paper, we propose a scheme for matrix-matrix
                 multiplication on a distributed-memory parallel
                 computer. The scheme hides almost all of the
                 communication cost with the computation and uses the
                 standard, optimized Level-3 BLAS operation on each
                 node. As a result, the overall performance of the
                 scheme is nearly equal to the performance of the
                 Level-3 optimized BLAS operation times the number of
                 nodes in the computer, which is the peak performance
                 obtainable for parallel BLAS. Another feature of our
                 algorithm is that it can give peak performance for
                 larger matrices, even if the underlying communication
                 network of the computer is slow.",

  abstract =     "In the last three decades a large number of compiler
                 transformations for optimizing programs have been
                 implemented. Most optimizations for uniprocessors
                 reduce the number of instructions executed by the
                 program using transformations based on the analysis of
                 scalar quantities and data-flow techniques. In
                 contrast, optimizations for high-performance
                 superscalar, vector, and parallel processors maximize
                 parallelism and memory locality with transformations
                 that rely on tracking the properties of arrays using
                 loop dependence analysis.\par

                 This survey is a comprehensive overview of the
                 important high-level program restructuring techniques
                 for imperative languages, such as C and Fortran.
                 Transformations for both sequential and various types
                 of parallel architectures are covered in depth. We
                 describe the purpose of each transformation, explain
                 how to determine if it is legal, and give an example of
                 its application.\par

                 Programmers wishing to enhance the performance of their
                 code can use this survey to improve their understanding
                 of the optimizations that compilers can perform, or as
                 a reference for techniques to be applied manually.
                 Students can obtain an overview of optimizing compiler
                 technology. Compiler writers can use this survey as a
                 reference for most of the important optimizations
                 developed to date, and as bibliographic reference for
                 the details of each optimization. Readers are expected
                 to be familiar with modern computer architecture and
                 basic program compilation techniques.",

  abstract =     "We are designing a zero-copy ATM interface called
                 MINI, the Memory Integrated Network Interface. MINI has
                 a target bandwidth of 1 Gbit/sec and will support
                 application-to-application latency of 1.2 microseconds.
                 MINI is a multi-user ATM interface which resides in the
                 memory space of the computer system, as opposed to I/O
                 space. Applications will have direct access to pages of
                 memory which are used for the network I/O; thus
                 applications can send and receive packets with no
                 operating system support needed. An application can
                 initiate packet transmission with one memory write; it
                 can determine if a packet has arrived by checking a
                 per-circuit control and status word. At the same time,
                 the operating system can use MINI for its own
                 communications and for supporting standard networking
                 software such as TCP/IP and NFS. Initial structural
                 VHDL simulations have shown that for single ATM cells
                 we can `bounce' an ATM cell from application to
                 application in a round-trip-time of 3.9 microseconds
                 (including software overhead on the relaying node), at
                 a bandwidth of 10 Mbytes/second. For 960-byte packets,
                 the bandwidth is 103 Mbytes/second. The architecture of
                 MINI is motivated by our experiences with applications
                 we have run in cluster and distributed computing
                 environments. We have used from 48 to 200 computers per
                 application, and have observed that successful
                 applications are ones that use the network very little.
                 The MINI design is targeted at the kinds of
                 applications we can not currently run, those that need
                 to send or receive data at very frequent intervals.",

  abstract =     "In a signal processing environment, cross ambiguity
                 functions are often used to detect when one signal is a
                 time and/or frequency shift of another. They consist of
                 multiple cross-correlations, which can be computed
                 efficiently using complex valued FFTs. This paper
                 discusses the implementation of cross ambiguity
                 functions on the MasPar MP-2, a SIMD processor array.
                 Two different implementations are developed. The first
                 computes each cross ambiguity function serially, using
                 FFT code that parallelizes across the complete set of
                 processors. The second uses the MasPar IORAM to realign
                 the data so that the cross ambiguity functions can be
                 computed in parallel. In this case, multiple FFTs are
                 executed in parallel on subsets of the processors,
                 which lowers the overall amount of communication
                 required.",

  abstract =     "Current I/O benchmarks suffer from several chronic
                 problems: they quickly become obsolete; they do not
                 stress the I/O system; and they do not help much in
                 understanding I/O system performance. We propose a new
                 approach to I/O performance analysis. First, we propose
                 a self-scaling benchmark that dynamically adjusts
                 aspects of its workload according to the performance
                 characteristic of the system being measured. By doing
                 so, the benchmark automatically scales across current
                 and future systems. The evaluation aids in
                 understanding system performance by reporting how
                 performance varies according to each of five workload
                 parameters. Second, we propose predicted performance, a
                 technique for using the results from the self-scaling
                 evaluation to estimate quickly the performance for
                 workloads that have not been measured. We show that
                 this technique yields reasonably accurate performance
                 estimates and argue that this method gives a far more
                 accurate comparative performance evaluation than
                 traditional single-point benchmarks. We apply our new
                 evaluation technique by measuring a SPARCstation 1+
                 with one SCSI disk, an HP 730 with one SCSI-II disk, a
                 DECstation 5000/200 running the Sprite LFS operating
                 system with a three-disk disk array, a Convex C240
                 minisupercomputer with a four-disk disk array, and a
                 Solbourne 5E/905 fileserver with a two-disk disk

                 source-to-source transformation of code for enhanced
                 execution performance on vector and SIMD architectures.
                 This work focuses on simple examples of program
                 unification to explain the methodology and demonstrate
                 its promise as a practical technique for improved
                 performance. Using simple examples to explain how
                 unification is done, we outline two experiments in the
                 simulation domain that benefit from unification, namely
                 Monte Carlo and discrete-event simulation. Empirical
                 tests of unified code on a Cray Y-MP multiprocessor
                 show that unification improves execution performance by
                 a factor of roughly 8 for given application. The
                 technique is general in that it can be applied to
                 computation-intensive programs in various data-parallel

                 This paper examines the problem of factoring large
                 sparse matrices on data-parallel computers. A
                 multifrontal approach is presented in which only the
                 fine-grain concurrency found within the elimination of
                 each supernode is exploited. Throughput approaching
                 that of large dense matrix factorizations is
                 demonstrated on two data-parallel systems, the MasPar
                 MP-2 and the Thinking Machines CM-5.",

  abstract =     "The existence of reconfigurable logic arrays has made
                 it possible to create on the same physical hardware
                 platform many different virtual circuits: a
                 configuration bit stream loaded into the logic array
                 determines the virtual circuit which is to be emulated.
                 The virtual logic can be used to create new
                 instructions which supplement the instruction set of a
                 conventional processor (as demonstrated, for example,
                 in [2] and [3]) or alternatively can operate as a
                 parallel co-processor, as shown in the Splash systems
                 [8] and [9]. The ease of hardware reconfiguration has
                 not been accompanied by a corresponding capability in
                 the software environment. In most cases, schematic
                 capture tools, textual hardware description languages,
                 or low-level vendor-specific tools must be used to
                 create new configurations. Research into high level
                 synthesis for reconfigurable arrays has begun, however,
                 as evidenced by the PRISM-2 tools of [3] and the dbC
                 translation system of [9]. The ability to write
                 algorithms for these arrays in high level procedural
                 language is key to their effective use. In this paper
                 we describe the data-parallel bit C system which is
                 used to program a reconfigurable logic array as a
                 custom SIMD co-processor. The dbC language has
                 bit-oriented extensions to C which give the programmer
                 control over the size of parallel data objects, so that
                 the data size requirements of the algorithm can be
                 accurately reflected in the hardware. The data parallel
                 extensions provide the ability to define a SIMD
                 processor array; to operate on data in the processors'
                 memories; to perform global reductions over the
                 processor array; and to communicate data between
                 nearest neighbor processing elements. We describe the
                 major components of our translation system and show how
                 it is mapped onto the Splash 2 system.",

  abstract =     "During the four years since the RISC System\slash
                 6000* (RS\slash 6000) announcement in February of 1990,
                 IBM* has strengthened its product line with
                 microprocessor enhancements, increased memory capacity,
                 improved graphics, greatly expanded I/O adapters, and
                 new AIX* and compiler releases. In 1991, IBM began
                 planning for future RS\slash 6000 systems that would
                 span the range from small, battery-operated products to
                 very large supercomputers and mainframes. As the first
                 step toward achieving this ``palmtop to teraFLOPS''
                 goal with a single architecture, IBM investigated
                 further optimizations for the original POWER
                 Architecture*. This effort led to the creation of the
                 PowerPC* alliance (IBM Corporation, Motorola*, Inc.,
                 and Apple* Computer Corporation) and the definition of
                 the PowerPC Architecture*. Today, the single-chip
                 PowerPC 601* processor is the basis of IBM's entry
                 systems. A more aggressively superscalar version of the
                 original POWER processor, the multichip POWER2*
                 processor, is exploited in our current IBM high-end
                 RISC systems. As technology continues to advance,
                 PowerPC implementations will provide the basis for
                 high-performance 64-bit super servers. This special
                 issue of the IBM Journal of Research and Development
                 focuses on the POWER2 and PowerPC portions of IBM's
                 wide-ranging announcement in the Fall of 1993. The new
                 POWER2 processor nearly doubles the performance of the
                 earlier high-end models. The PowerPC 601 processor was
                 introduced in the RISC System\slash 6000 Model 250, the
                 first system in the industry to use the PowerPC
                 Architecture created by the strategic
                 IBM/Motorola/Apple alliance. These workstations
                 achieved industry-leading performance and
                 price/performance on virtually every industry-standard
                 benchmark, including SPECint92*, SPECfp92*, Linpack,
                 TPP, TPC-A*, and TPC-C*. Compared to the 1990
                 offerings, SPEC performance nearly quadrupled,
                 transaction performance improved by a factor of almost
                 five, maximum memory capacity quadrupled, and the
                 maximum disk capacity grew by an order of magnitude.
                 The POWER2 design exploits both multichip technology
                 and a larger die size to execute up to six instructions
                 (eight operations) per clock cycle. Many of the
                 higher-performance POWER2-based systems provide peak
                 execution rates in excess of a half billion operations
                 per second. The paper by White and Dhawan provides an
                 overview of the POWER2 design. Shippy and Griffith
                 describe the dual fixed-point unit design, the data
                 cache unit, and the storage control unit. Hicks, Fry,
                 and Harvey describe the dual floating-point unit
                 design. Barreh et al. describe hardware strategies to
                 minimize compare-branch penalties in the instruction
                 cache unit. Welbon et al. describe a POWER2 hardware
                 performance- monitoring facility which provides
                 execution characteristics that can identify
                 opportunities for application performance improvement.
                 This facility can also be used to gather information
                 crucial to future design decisions. Two performance
                 papers conclude the POWER2 portion of this issue.
                 Franklin et al. analyze some of the key POWER2 hardware
                 contributions to performance on the commercial
                 workloads. Agarwal, Gustavson, and Zubair relate their
                 experiences with optimizing the high-performance
                 Engineering/Scientific Subroutine Library (ESSL) for
                 the POWER2 implementation. While POWER2 and PowerPC
                 implementations provide the opportunity for
                 high-performance systems, optimizing software is also
                 key in delivering end-user performance. Blainey
                 describes aspects of the TOBEY compiler, with special
                 emphasis on instruction scheduling for the RS\slash
                 6000 products. Heisch describes TDPR, a prototype
                 version of FDPR, a program restructuring tool which
                 improves application performance by placing frequently
                 executed code blocks so as to minimize instruction
                 cache misses and branch penalties. IBM and the PowerPC
                 alliance are currently developing a family of five
                 PowerPC designs. IBM and Motorola designers at the
                 Somerset Design Center in Austin will optimize
                 single-chip implementations of the PowerPC Architecture
                 for high-volume products. The high-end requirements of
                 the large server and workstation products will be
                 addressed with multichip PowerPC implementations from
                 IBM.\par IBM entry-level workstation products
                 introduced the PowerPC 601 microprocessor, the first
                 member of the PowerPC family. The goal for the PowerPC
                 601 designers was to quickly bring PowerPC to the
                 market. Vaden et al. describe the microarchitecture and
                 performance aspects of the PowerPC 601 processor.
                 Brodnax et al. discuss the PowerPC 601 circuitry and
                 chip implementation details. Future products are
                 planned that will incorporate the PowerPC 603*, PowerPC
                 604*, and the 64-bit PowerPC 620* implementations as
                 they become available. In addition, the price and
                 price/performance of the PowerPC family enable
                 lower-cost ``RISC PCs'' to be built using PowerPC
                 microprocessors. These ``RISC PCs'' will be developed
                 by the IBM POWER Personal Systems Division.\par The
                 PowerPC and POWER2 systems signify a major milestone in
                 IBM's commitment to the ``palmtops to teraFLOPS''
                 strategy. The PowerPC 601 chip extends the entry
                 products further into the high-volume market by
                 providing exceptional performance in a low-cost
                 single-chip microprocessor. The high-end POWER2
                 implementation extracts the maximum performance
                 achievable in today's technology, thrusting the IBM
                 RISC processors into the supercomputing and
                 large-server environments. IBM POWER Parallel Systems
                 extends the RS\slash 6000 processing capability by
                 providing IBM POWER Parallel SP2* systems with up to
                 512 POWER/POWER2 nodes. In addition to scalability,
                 four-way High Availability Cluster Multi-Processor
                 (HACMP) systems provide the reliability/availability
                 that one would expect from mainframe-class systems by
                 supporting a ``no single point of failure'' capability,
                 even when one processor is off line. This impressive
                 base of processing technology complements a commitment
                 to high-performance compilers and strong graphics
                 offerings.\par This robust product line addresses the
                 cost-driven requirements of the entry workstation
                 market, the transaction and server requirements of the
                 commercial market, and the computation-intensive
                 requirements of the technical market. These hardware
                 offerings result from a team effort by many dedicated
                 and talented individuals from around the world. Their
                 expertise and skill in a wide range of disciplines were
                 key to achieving this significant step toward the goal
                 of a comprehensive architecture. We want to thank all
                 those involved in continuing the success of the RISC
                 System\slash 6000 line.",

                 of multivariate integer polynomials. Motivated by their
                 result, we adapt an old approach of Mahler [6] to
                 provide the first explicit measure of algebraic
                 independence for e[superscript
                 gab1s],\ldots{},e[superscript gas[subscript m]], where
                 gab1s,\ldots{},gas[subscript m] are algebraic numbers
                 linearly independent over the rationals. We also show
                 that, because of the amount of precision required,
                 these explicit measures of algebraic independence are
                 not strong enough, even in the most promising cases, to
                 produce fast factorizations of multivariate integer

                 solution of partial differential equation models of the
                 nervous system. These models mathematically are
                 one-dimensional nonlinear parabolic equations defined
                 on branching domains. Implicit methods for these
                 equations leads to numerical solution of diagonally
                 dominant almost tridiagonal linear systems at each time
                 step. We first review some exact methods for the
                 solution of these linear systems that includes an Exact
                 Domain Decomposition. This EDD leads to the solution of
                 many tridiagonal linear systems one for each branch.
                 The sizes of these systems is equal to the number of
                 grid points on the branch. Since the branches of
                 realistic neurons vary widely in size, the
                 decomposition leads to a very poor a priori load
                 balance. This problem may be solved with the Overlapped
                 Partition Method, a method for decomposing large
                 diagonally dominant tridiagonal systems. We describe
                 and analyze an algorithm based on EDD and OPM that can
                 be load balanced.",

                 implementation of the backpropagation algorithm (BP) on
                 the CM-5 by fully taking advantage of its Control
                 Network to avoid explicit message-passing. The nodes in
                 the input and output layers are evenly distributed to
                 all processors: all nodes in the hidden layer(s) are
                 replicated in each processor, and all weights are
                 distributed to all processors corresponding to the
                 nodes. We have implemented this algorithm on the CM-5
                 in the MIMD mode using the C programming language. For
                 a case study of protein tertiary structure prediction,
                 we obtained performance of 76 million weight updates
                 per second (WUPS) with the machine partitioned for 512
                 processors without vector units. Experiments using
                 different sized partitions indicated an almost linear
                 relationship between the computation time and the
                 number of processors, indicating good parallelization.
                 We have also implemented the backpropagation algorithm
                 on the Cray machines using the C programming language.
                 The Cray-2 implementation yields performance of 10
                 million WUPS; the Cray X-MP EA implementation yields 18
                 million WUPS; and the Cray Y-MP M92 implementation

  abstract =     "We describe in detail the parallel implementation of
                 an additive lagged-Fibonacci pseudorandom number
                 generator. Elsewhere, [8], it was shown how important
                 properties of these generators lead to an obvious
                 parallel implementation based on deterministic seeding.
                 Seeds are calculated to select one of a large number of
                 full-period cycles, or equivalence classes. This
                 `naive' implementation is computationally efficient and
                 produces a high-quality, portable, and totally
                 reproducible parallel generator. A drawback of the
                 `naive' implementation is that it produces sequences
                 that have initial segments of poor quality. In
                 addition, the initial segments from the equivalence
                 classes of different parallel processes are similar.
                 The simplest solution to this problem is rejected due
                 to its computational cost. Instead, a different seeding
                 algorithm is described. The new algorithm can be viewed
                 as an alternative enumeration of the equivalence
                 classes. The new algorithm is computationally more
                 efficient and avoids the quality problems of the
                 `naive' implementation. We believe that this algorithm
                 solves the reproducibility problem for a far larger
                 class of parallel Monte Carlo applications than had
                 been previously possible. In fact, this generator
                 allows one to write code that is reproducible
                 independent both of the number of processors and the
                 execution order of the parallel processes. Finally, a
                 library of portable C routines is described that
                 implements these ideas. These routines are available
                 from the authors.",

                 memory access control, which selectively restricts
                 reads and writes to cache-block-sized memory regions.
                 Fine-grain access control forms the basis of efficient
                 cache-coherent shared memory. This paper focuses on
                 low-cost implementations that require little or no
                 additional hardware. These techniques permit efficient
                 implementation of shared memory on a wide range of
                 parallel systems, thereby providing shared-memory codes
                 with a portability previously limited to message
                 passing. This paper categorizes techniques based on
                 where access control is enforced and where access
                 conflicts are handled. We incorporated three techniques
                 that require no additional hardware into Blizzard, a
                 system that supports distributed shared memory on the
                 CM-5. The first adds a software lookup before each
                 shared-memory reference by modifying the program's
                 executable. The second uses the memory's error
                 correcting code (ECC) as cache-block valid bits. The
                 third is a hybrid. The software technique ranged from
                 slightly faster to two times slower than the ECC
                 approach. Blizzard's performance is roughly comparable
                 to a hardware shared-memory machine. These results
                 argue that clusters of workstations or personal
                 computers with networks comparable to the CM-5's will
                 be able to support the same shared-memory interfaces as
                 supercomputers.",

                 ATM has prompted a need for fast error-control
                 mechanisms. CRCs have the distinction of being one of
                 the most popular and simple fault tolerant
                 implementations in use today. Traditionally, they are
                 computed serially in lockstep with outgoing or incoming
                 datagrams; this approach can become difficult, if not
                 impossible, when applied to high-speed networking. Our
                 study of CRCs has yielded a parallel algorithm that can
                 compute a CRC for any arbitrary length datagram. For
                 example, 937 XORs are required to calculate an IEEE-802
                 CRC-32 for a 64-bit word; large datagrams can be broken
                 down into a group of 64-bit cells and have their CRCs
                 constructed as each cell is transmitted across a
                 network. Clearly, this serial and parallel approach is
                 more efficient than the traditional lockstep scheme.
                 Using a fast FPGA, a CRC-32 for a 64-bit cell can be
                 calculated in three or four levels of combinatorial
                 logic. A custom-made ASIC could potentially calculate a
                 CRC in as fast as 10 ns.",

  abstract =     "Most recent MPP systems employ a fast microprocessor
                 surrounded by a shell of communication and
                 synchronization logic. The CRAY-T3D${}^1$ provides an
                 elaborate shell to support global-memory access,
                 prefetch, atomic operations, barriers, and block
                 transfers. We provide a detailed empirical performance
                 characterization of these primitives using
                 micro-benchmarks and evaluate their utility in
                 compiling for a parallel language. We have found that
                 the raw performance of the machine is quite impressive
                 and the most effective forms of communication are
                 prefetch and write. Other shell provisions, such as the
                 bulk transfer engine and the external Annex register
                 set, are cumbersome and of little use. By evaluating
                 the system in the context of a language implementation,
                 we shed light on important trade-offs and pitfalls in
                 the machine architecture.",

                 at a rate greater than memory speed. Indeed, current

                 the single and double large prime variations (PMPQS,
                 and PPMPQS, respectively) of the quadratic sieve
                 factorization method on SGI workstations, and on a Cray
                 C90 vectorcomputer. Experiments with 71-, 87-, and
                 99-digit numbers show that for our Cray C90
                 implementations PPMPQS beats PMPQS for numbers of more
                 than 80 digits, and this cross-over point goes down
                 with the amount of available central memory. For PMPQS
                 a known theoretical formula is worked out and tested
                 that helps to predict the total running time on the
                 basis of a short test run. The accuracy of the
                 prediction is within 10\% of the actual running time.
                 For PPMPQS such a prediction formula is not known and
                 the determination of an optimal choice of the
                 parameters for a given number would require many full
                 runs with that given number, and the use of an
                 inadmissible amount of CPU-time. In order yet to
                 provide measurements that can help to determine a good
                 choice of the parameters in PPMPQS, we have factored
                 many numbers in the 66 - 88 decimal digits range, where
                 each number was run once with a specific choice of the
                 parameters. In addition, an experimental prediction
                 formula is given that has a restricted scope in the
                 sense that it only applies to numbers of a given size,
                 for a fixed choice of the parameters of PPMPQS. So such
                 a formula may be useful if one wishes to factor many
                 different large numbers of about the same size with
                 PPMPQS.",

  abstract =     "Irregular loop nests in which the loop bounds are
                 determined dynamically by indexed arrays are difficult
                 to compile into expressive parallel constructs, such as
                 segmented scans and reductions. In this paper, we
                 describe a suite of transformations to automatically
                 parallelize such irregular loop nests, even in the
                 presence of recurrences. We describe a simple, general
                 loop flattening transformation, along with new
                 optimizations which make it a viable compiler
                 transformation. A robust recurrence parallelization
                 technique is coupled to the loop flattening
                 transformation, allowing parallelization of segmented
                 reductions, scans and combining-sends over arbitrary
                 associative operators. We discuss the implementation
                 and performance results of the transformations in a
                 parallelizing Fortran 77 compiler for the Cray C90
                 supercomputer. In particular, we focus on important
                 sparse matrix-vector multiplication kernels, for one of
                 which we are able to automatically derive an algorithm

                 to evaluate the performance of highly-parallel
                 supercomputers. These benchmarks are unstructured in
                 the sense that they give only an algorithm defining the
                 benchmark; all implementation details are left to the
                 programmer. We looked specifically at a kernel to solve
                 an unstructured sparse linear system via the conjugate
                 gradient method, the CG kernel. This kernel was
                 implemented on one of the newest massively-parallel
                 supercomputers, the Cray T3D. Currently, our
                 implementation of the CG kernel on the T3D achieves 306
                 MFlops on 64 processors. In comparison, a Cray YMP
                 single head gets 127 MFlops, a 128 processor iPSC/860
                 gets 181 MFlops, and a 32,768 processor CM-2 gets 105

                 interval Newton/generalized bisection method to find
                 all numerical solutions to systems of nonlinear
                 equations. Since INTBIS uses interval computations, its

                 efficiently solve very large nonlinear systems on a

                 effectively utilize the architectural features of the
                 machine. In this paper, we report our implementations
                 of INTBIS for large nonlinear systems on the Cray Y-MP
                 supercomputer. We first present the direct
                 implementation of INTBIS on a Cray. Then, we report our
                 work on optimizing INTBIS on the Cray Y-MP.",

                 Internet, it is important for them to access the vast
                 amount of information in an efficient and easy manner.
                 This project explores one of the possibilities for
                 providing an integrated system to the user to access
                 the different types of media like text, image, audio
                 and video stored in different databases on remote
                 machines without the user having to know about the
                 underlying mechanism involved in accessing the
                 database. Such a system must hide the location of the
                 remote data, retrieve the information, process the
                 results and present it to the user. We have used the
                 National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA)
                 Mosaic's Gateway Structured Query Language (GSQL),
                 which enables a system developer to build input forms,
                 query to the remote database in a relatively easy
                 manner and present the results to the user. With the
                 help of this prototype, the development time to build
                 such an application is considerably reduced as compared
                 with developing the same application using the existing
                 Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools like the X-Window
                 system.",

                 developed by Safwat and Magnanti [1988]. An Efficient
                 algorithm to solve the STEM on mainframe computers was
                 tested on a VAX 8650 minicomputer and then on a CRAY
                 Y-MP/2 supercomputer with different levels of code
                 vectorization. The application involved one example
                 network and another real-world urban transportation
                 network. Computational results indicate that simple
                 modifications to vectorize selected portions of the
                 code and the use of supercomputer have led to a
                 computational speed 9 times faster compared with the
                 original code on the VAX. These results would encourage

  abstract =     "In this paper we consider the CRAY APP, the Attached
                 Parallel Processor of the CRAY S-MP, which consists of
                 seven buses with each bus supporting up to 12
                 processing elements. Processing elements on different
                 buses can communicate simultaneously with the shared
                 main memory, but processing elements sharing the same
                 bus can not, since only one processing element per bus
                 can access memory at a given time. Applications with a
                 high level of data reuse, or, with a high computation
                 intensity, and applications being highly parallel are
                 very suitable to run on the APP. An example of such an
                 algorithm is matrix-matrix multiplication. We
                 illustrate how the data traffic's restriction
                 influences the performance and we discuss a performance
                 model of the bus architecture, considering a change in
                 processor speed, data traffic speed and cache contents.
                 Furthermore, two different algorithms for Cholesky
                 factorization are discussed: a block left-looking
                 algorithm and a block right-looking algorithm. The
                 maximum achievable speed on the CRAY APP is mainly
                 determined by the performance of the matrix-matrix
                 multiplication. Parallelism is applied explicitly over
                 the blocks, which makes it possible to concatenate
                 different block operations in cache. The results
                 obtained on CWI's APP (a machine having twenty-eight
                 processing elements) indicate how block algorithms can
                 be parallelized on machines with hundreds or thousands
                 of processors.",

  abstract =     "This paper describes recent work using iterative
                 methods for the solution of linear systems in the ANSYS
                 program. The ANSYS program, a general purpose finite
                 element code widely used in structural analysis
                 applications, has now added an iterative solver option.
                 The development of robust iterative solvers and their
                 use in commercial programs is discussed. Discussion of
                 the applicability of iterative solvers as a general
                 purpose solver will include the topics of robustness;
                 as well as memory requirements and CPU performance. A
                 new iterative solver for general purpose finite element
                 codes which functions as a `black-box' solver using
                 element-specific information and the underlying problem
                 physics to construct an effective and inexpensive
                 preconditioner is described. Some results are given
                 from realistic examples comparing the performance of
                 the iterative solver implemented in ANSYS with the
                 traditional parallel\slash vector frontal solver used
                 in ANSYS and a robust shifted incomplete Choleski
                 iterative solver.",

                 of basis vectors of Krylov subspaces. The number of

                 the number of iterations that has to be performed, that
                 is if no restart or truncation strategy is employed.
                 The number of iterations can be reduced by performing
                 more matrix-vector multiplications per iteration, for
                 example by applying a polynomial preconditioner or by
                 performing inner iterations. In this paper we discuss
                 this approach and we compare some of the resulting
                 GMRES methods. The experimental comparison has been

                 trees of order n forces a tree T if every graph having
                 each tree in S as a spanning tree must also have T as a
                 spanning tree. A spanning tree forcing set for order n
                 is a set of trees of order n that forces every tree of
                 order n. A spanning-tree forcing set S is a test set
                 for panarboreal graphs, since a graph of order n is
                 panarboreal if and only if it has all of the trees in S
                 as spanning trees. For each positive integer n [not
                 equal to] 1, the star belongs to every spanning tree
                 forcing set for order n. The main results of this paper
                 are a proof that the path belongs to every
                 spanning-tree forcing set for each order n [not element
                 of] [1,6,7,8] and a computationally tractable
                 characterization of the trees of order n[> or =]15
                 forced by the path and the star. Corollaries of those
                 results include a construction of many trees that do
                 not belong to any minimal spanning tree forcing set for
                 orders n[> or =]15 and a proof that the following
                 related decision problem is NP-complete: an instance is
                 a pair (G,T) consisting of a graph G of order n and
                 maximum degree n-1 with a Hamiltonian path, and a tree
                 T of order n; the problem is to determine whether T is
                 a spanning tree of G.''",

                 be exercised and revised, before they can be
                 implemented on a large network. We have built a
                 platform that supports the evaluation of network
                 architectures. The platform allows us to closely
                 approximate the functional and dynamic behavior of
                 network control systems. By providing support for
                 real-time visualization and interactive emulation, it
                 can be used to study multimedia networks in various
                 scenarios, such as different load patterns, network
                 sizes and management operations. The current
                 implementation runs on a KSR-1 and an SP2 parallel
                 processor, which are connected to a graphics
                 workstation via ATM links. We use the platform in
                 several projects, one of which aims at developing an

                 The resulting software package, MA42, is included in
                 Release 11 of the Harwell Subroutine Library and is
                 intended to supersede the earlier MA32 package. We
                 discuss in detail the extensive use of higher-level
                 BLAS kernels within MA42 and illustrate the performance
                 on a range of practical problems on a CRAY Y-MP, an IBM
                 3090, and an IBM RISC System/6000. We examine extending
                 the frontal solution scheme to use multiple fronts to
                 allow MA42 to be run in parallel. We indicate some

                 been independently discovered many times. The algorithm
                 can be viewed as a generalization of the normalized LMS
                 (NLMS) algorithm that updates on the basis of multiple
                 input signal vectors. This correspondence compares and
                 discusses the different approaches to and
                 embellishments of the basic algorithm, and contrasts
                 the various interpretations from different

  abstract =     "The decision to use ASIC technology over a full- or
                 semi-custom approach in the design of a computer system
                 is influenced by many factors, and has a significant
                 impact on the design methodology as well as on the
                 completion schedule of the product. The Cray Research
                 J90* line of 100-MHz supercomputer systems is an
                 example of a system whose performance, cost, and
                 schedule needs drove the designers to an ASIC solution.
                 The J90 comprises varying numbers of ten unique ASICs,
                 each designed in a 0.5-$\mu$m CMOS technology. The
                 largest of the ASICs contains more than 500,000
                 equivalent two-way NAND CMOS gates. The design cycle,
                 including integrated circuit and first-level packaging
                 technology selection, took just over two years from
                 concept to production. This paper presents a brief
                 history of the Cray ELS (Entry-Level Systems) division
                 and discusses some of the decision processes and
                 trade-offs made during the design of the J90 system,
                 including the decision to use ASIC technology, and its
                 effect on the overall design methodology and CAD flow.
                 The design methodology, which utilized a
                 ground-rule-based HDL/synthesis approach, and the
                 physical design of the chips, which made use of
                 industry-standard and vendor-proprietary tools, are
                 discussed. Finally, conclusions as to the applicability
                 and the success of utilizing an ``off-the-shelf'' ASIC
                 technology are drawn.",

  abstract =     "General software for preconditioning the iterative
                 solution of linear systems is greatly lagging behind
                 the literature. This is partly because specific
                 problems and specific matrix and preconditioner data
                 structures in order to be solved efficiently, i.e.,
                 multiple implementations of a preconditioner with
                 specialized data structures are required. This article
                 presents a framework to support preconditioning with
                 various, possibly user-defined, data structures for
                 matrices that are partitioned into blocks. The main
                 idea is to define data structures for the blocks, and
                 an upper layer of software which uses these blocks
                 transparently of their data structure. This
                 transparency can be accomplished by using an
                 object-oriented language. Thus, various
                 preconditioners, such as block relaxations and
                 block-incomplete factorizations, only need to be
                 defined once and will work with any block type. In
                 addition, it is possible to transparently interchange
                 various approximate or exact techniques for inverting
                 pivot blocks, or solving systems whose coefficient
                 matrices are diagonal blocks. This leads to a rich
                 variety of preconditioners that can be selected.
                 Operations with the blocks are performed with optimized
                 libraries or fundamental data types. Comparisons with
                 an optimized Fortran 77 code on both workstations and
                 Cray supercomputers show that this framework can
                 approach the efficiency of Fortran 77, as long as
                 suitable block sized and block types are chosen.",

  abstract =     "In recent years, a large number of parallel
                 computation models have been proposed to replace the
                 PRAM as the parallel computation model presented to the
                 algorithm designer. Although mostly the theoretical
                 justifications for these models are sound, and many
                 algorithmic results where obtained through these
                 models, little experimentation has been conducted to
                 validate the effectiveness of these models for
                 developing cost-effective algorithms and applications
                 on existing hardware platforms. In this article a first
                 attempt is made to perform a detailed experimental
                 account on the preciseness of these models. The achieve
                 this, three models (BSP, E-BSP, and BPRAM) were
                 selected and validated on five parallel platforms (Cray
                 T3E, Thinking Machines CM-5, Intel Paragon, MasPar
                 MP-1, and Parsytec GCel). The work described in this
                 article consists of three parts. First, the predictive
                 capabilities of the models are investigated. Unlike
                 previous experimental work, which mostly demonstrated a
                 close match between the measured and predicted
                 execution times, this article shows that there are
                 several situations in which the models do not precisely
                 predict the actual runtime behavior of an algorithm
                 implementation. Second, a comparison between the models
                 is provided in order to determine the model that
                 induces that most efficient algorithms. Lastly, the
                 performance achieved by the model-derived algorithms is
                 compared with the performance attained by
                 machine-specific algorithms in order to examine the
                 effectiveness of deriving fast algorithms through the
                 formalisms of the models.",

  abstract =     "Given a program and some input data, partial deduction
                 computes a specialized program handling any remaining
                 input more efficiently. However, controlling the
                 process well is a rather difficult problem. In this
                 article, we elaborate global control for partial
                 deduction: for which atoms, among possibly infinitely
                 many, should specialized relations be produced,
                 meanwhile guaranteeing correctness as well as
                 termination. Our work is based on two ingredients.
                 First, we use the concept of a characteristic tree,
                 encapsulating specialization behavior rather than
                 syntactic structure, to guide generalization and
                 polyvariance, and we show how this can be done in a
                 correct and elegant way. Second, we structure
                 combinations of atoms and associated characteristic
                 trees in global trees registering ``causal''
                 relationships among such pairs. This allows us to spot
                 looming nontermination and perform proper
                 generalization in order to avert the danger, without
                 having to impose a depth bound on characteristic trees.
                 The practical relevance and benefits of the work are
                 illustrated through extensive experiments. Finally, a
                 similar approach may improve upon current (on-line)
                 control strategies for program transformation in
                 general such as (positive) supercompilation of
                 functional programs. It also seems valuable in the
                 context of abstract interpretation to handle infinite
                 domains of infinite height with more precision.",

  abstract =     "In this article we investigate the trade-off between
                 time and space efficiency in scheduling and executing
                 parallel irregular computations on distributed-memory
                 machines. We employ acyclic task dependence graphs to
                 model irregular parallelism with mixed granularity, and
                 we use direct remote memory access to support fast
                 communication. We propose new scheduling techniques and
                 a run-time active memory management scheme to improve
                 memory utilization while retaining good time
                 efficiency, and we provide a theoretical analysis on
                 correctness and performance. This work is implemented
                 in the context of the RAPID system which uses an
                 inspector/executor approach to parallelize irregular
                 computations at run-time. We demonstrate the
                 effectiveness of the proposed techniques on several
                 irregular applications such as sparse matrix code and
                 the fast multipole method for particle simulation. Our
                 experimental results on Cray-T3E show that problems
                 large sizes can be solved under limited space capacity,
                 and that the loss of execution efficiency caused by the

  abstract =     "We describe a version of the Level 3 BLAS which is
                 designed to be efficient on RISC processors. This is an
                 extension of previous studies by the authors and
                 colleagues on a similar approach for efficient serial
                 and parallel implementations on virtual-memory and
                 shared-memory multiprocessors. All our codes are
                 written in Fortran and use loop-unrolling, blocking,
                 and copying to improve the performance. A blocking
                 technique is used to express the BLAS in terms of
                 operations involving triangular blocks and calls to the
                 matrix-matrix multiplication kernel (GEMM). No
                 manufacturer-supplied or assembler code is used. This
                 blocked implementation uses the same blocking ideas as
                 in our implementation for vector machines except that
                 the ordering of loops is designed for efficient reuse
                 of date held in cache and not necessarily for
                 parallelization. All the codes are specifically tuned
                 for RISC processors. The software also includes a tuned
                 version of GEMM. A parameter which controls the
                 blocking allows efficient exploitation of the memory
                 hierarchy on the various target computers. We present
                 results on a range of RISC-based workstations and
                 multiprocessors: CRAY T3D, DEC 8400 5/300, HP 715/64,
                 IBM SP2, MEIKO CS2-HA, SGI Power Challenge 10000, and
                 SUN UltraSPARC-1 model 140. This implementation of the
                 Level 3 BLAS is available on anonymous FTP, and we
                 welcome input from users to improve and extend our BLAS
                 implementation.",

                 are used to obtain parallel streams of random numbers

                 the quality of lagged subsequences of RANF with step
                 sizes $2^l, l \geq 1$, appropriate for CRAY systems.
                 Our results demonstrate that with increasing $l$, the
                 quality of lagged subsequences is strongly reduced in
                 comparison to the original sequence. The results are
                 supported by a numerical Monte Carlo integration study.

  abstract =     "The integrated synchronous and asynchronous
                 collaboration (ISAAC) project [1] is constructing a
                 communication and collaboration system to bridge
                 traditional workgroup barriers of time and space.
                 Possible applications include military command and
                 control, corporate real-time collaboration, and
                 distributed teams of research scientists. Thus, this
                 system must host the widest possible range of
                 applications, and must run on heterogeneous hardware.
                 ISAAC incorporates real-time (synchronous)
                 collaboration technologies developed by the Habanero
                 project [2,3] at the National Center for Supercomputing
                 Applications at the University of Illinois
                 Urbana-Champaign, with asynchronous extensions. ISAAC
                 research is aimed at moving information between
                 synchronous and asynchronous modes. ISAAC's session
                 capture conceptually transforms a real-time multiple
                 tool collaboration into multimedia document, which can
                 be analyzed and reused by other programs. Automated
                 segmentation and indexing of captured audio and
                 videoteleconference traffic adds further information.",

  abstract =     "Customizing the protocols that manage accesses to
                 different data structures within an application can
                 improve the performance of software shared-memory
                 programs substantially. Existing systems for using
                 customizable protocols are hard to use directly because
                 the mechanisms they provide for manipulating protocols
                 are low-level ones. This article is an in-depth study
                 of the issues involved in providing language support
                 for application-specific protocols. We describe the
                 design and implementation of a new language for
                 parallel programming, Ace, that integrates support for
                 customizable protocols with minimal extensions to C.
                 Ace applications are developed using a shared-memory
                 model with a default sequentially consistent protocol.
                 Performance can then be optimized, with minor
                 modifications to the application, by experimenting with
                 different protocol libraries. The design of Ace was
                 driven by a detailed study of the use of customizable
                 protocols. We delineate the issues that arise when
                 programming with customizable protocols and present
                 novel abstractions that allow for their easy use. We
                 describe the design and implementation of a runtime
                 system and compiler for Ace nd discuss compiler
                 optimizations that improve the performance of such
                 software shared-memory systems. We study the
                 communication patterns of a set of benchmark
                 applications and consider the use of customizable
                 protocols to optimize their performance. We evaluate
                 the performance of our system through experiments on a
                 Thinking Machine CM-5 and a Cray T3E. We also present
                 measurements that demonstrate that Ace has good
                 performance compared to that of a modern distributed
                 shared-memory system.",

  abstract =     "Process migration is the act of transferring a process
                 between two machines. It enables dynamic load
                 distribution, fault resilience, eased system
                 administration, and data access locality. Despite these
                 goals and ongoing research efforts, migration has not
                 achieved widespread use. With the increasing deployment
                 of distributed systems in general, and distributed
                 operating systems in particular, process migration is
                 again receiving more attention in both research and
                 product development. As high-performance facilities
                 shift from supercomputers to networks of workstations,
                 and with the ever-increasing role of the World Wide
                 Web, we expect migration to play a more important role
                 and eventually to be widely adopted.\par This survey
                 reviews the field of process migration by summarizing
                 the key concepts and giving an overview of the most
                 important implementations. Design and implementation
                 issues of process migration are analyzed in general,
                 and then revisited for each of the case studies
                 described: MOSIX, Sprite, Mach, and Load Sharing
                 Facility. The benefits and drawbacks of process
                 migration depend on the details of implementation and,
                 therefore, this paper focuses on practical matters.
                 This survey will help in understanding the potentials
                 of process migration and why it has not caught on.",

                 comparison of two state-of-the-art direct solvers for
                 large sparse sets of linear equations on large-scale
                 distributed-memory computers. One is a multifrontal
                 solver called MUMPS, the other is a supernodal solver
                 called superLU. We describe the main algorithmic
                 features of the two solvers and compare their
                 performance characteristics with respect to
                 uniprocessor speed, interprocessor communication, and
                 memory requirements. For both solvers, preorderings for
                 numerical stability and sparsity play an important role
                 in achieving high parallel efficiency. We analyse the
                 results with various ordering algorithms. Our
                 performance analysis is based on data obtained from
                 runs on a 512-processor Cray T3E using a set of
                 matrices from real applications. We also use regular 3D
                 grid problems to study the scalability of the two
                 solvers.",

                 optimization of computationally intensive programs on
                 Sun UltraSPARC platforms. It is primarily intended for
                 developers of technical or high performance computing
                 (HPC) applications for the Solaris operating
                 environment. This audience includes both independent
                 software vendor (ISV) developers and noncommercial
                 developers. It can also be used by end-users of HPC
                 applications to help them better understand how
                 applications utilize system resources.\par The book
                 presents information so that it follows logical stages
                 of the process for application development and
                 optimization. Authors Garg and Shapov pay special
                 attention to issues related to parallel applications
                 and to using appropriate performance measurement tools.
                 Wherever applicable, sections are illustrated with code
                 examples that show benefits of methods described.\par
                 Unless otherwise noted, topics in this book are not
                 limited to a particular programming language,
                 parallelization method, software version, or hardware
                 product. However, emphasis is on techniques relevant to
                 applications written in Fortran 77, Fortran 90, and C,
                 because these languages are most commonly used in HPC
                 and technical applications. Most topics can be applied
                 to C++ programs; however, the authors do not address
                 performance optimization issues specific to
                 object-oriented programming.",

                 dual-processor compute nodes, was designed from the
                 ground up to support efficient execution of massively
                 parallel message-passing programs. Part of this support
                 is an optimized implementation of the Message Passing
                 Interface (MPI), which leverages the hardware features
                 of BG/L. MPI for BG/L is implemented on top of a more
                 basic message-passing infrastructure called the message
                 layer. This message layer can be used both to implement
                 other higher-level libraries and directly by
                 applications. MPI and the message layer are used in the
                 two BG/L modes of operation: the coprocessor mode and
                 the virtual node mode. Performance measurements show
                 that our message-passing services deliver performance
                 close to the hardware limits of the machine. They also
                 show that dedicating one of the processors of a node to
                 communication functions (coprocessor mode) greatly
                 improves the message-passing bandwidth, whereas running
                 two processes per compute node (virtual node mode) can
                 have a positive impact on application performance.",

  abstract =     "This paper describes partition allocation for parallel
                 jobs in the Blue Gene/L supercomputer. It describes the
                 novel network architecture of the Blue Gene/L (BG/L)
                 three-dimensional (3D) computational core and presents
                 a preliminary analysis of its properties and advantages
                 compared those of with more traditional systems. The
                 scalability challenge is solved in BG/L by sacrificing
                 granularity of system management. The system is treated
                 as a collection of composite allocation units that
                 contain both processing and communication resources. We
                 discuss the ensuing algorithmic framework for
                 computational and communication resource allocation and
                 present results of simulations that explore resource
                 utilization of BG/L for different workloads. We find
                 that utilization depends strongly on both the
                 predominant partition topology (mesh or torus) and the
                 3D shapes requested by the running jobs. When
                 communication links are treated as dedicated resources,
                 it is much more difficult to allocate toroidal
                 partitions than mesh ones, especially for jobs of more
                 than one allocation unit in each dimension. We show
                 that in these difficult cases, the advantage of BG/L
                 compared with a 3D toroidal machine of the same size is
                 very significant, with resource utilization better by a
                 factor of 2. In the easier cases (e.g., predominantly
                 mesh partitions), there are no disadvantages. The
                 advantage is primarily due to the BG/L novel
                 multi-toroidal topology that permits coallocation of
                 multiple toroidal partitions at negligible additional
                 cost.",

  abstract =     "A general method for optimizing problem layout on the
                 Blue Gene/L (BG/L) supercomputer is described. The
                 method takes as input the communication matrix of an
                 arbitrary problem as an array with entries $C(i, j)$,
                 which represents the data communicated from domain $i$
                 to domain $j$. Given $C(i, j)$, we implement a
                 heuristic map that attempts to sequentially map a
                 domain and its communication neighbors either to the
                 same BG/L node or to near-neighbor nodes on the BG/L
                 torus, while keeping the number of domains mapped to a
                 BG/L node constant. We then generate a Markov chain of
                 maps using Monte Carlo simulation with free energy $F =
                 \sum_{i,j} C(i, j)H(i, j)$, where $H(i, j)$ is the
                 smallest number of hops on the BG/L torus between
                 domain $i$ and domain $j$. For two large parallel
                 applications, SAGE and UMT2000, the method was tested
                 against the default Message Passing Interface rank
                 order layout on up to 2,048 BG/L nodes. It produced
                 maps that improved communication efficiency by up to
                 45\%.",

                 application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to
                 date, the Blue Gene/L compute chip presented unique
                 challenges that required extensions of the standard
                 ASIC synthesis, timing, and physical design

                 physical design, with emphasis on the novel features of
                 this ASIC. Among these are a process to easily inject
                 datapath placements for speed-critical circuits or to
                 relieve wire congestion, and a timing closure
                 methodology that resulted in timing closure for both
                 nominal and worst-case timing specifications. The

  abstract =     "As 1999 ended, IBM announced its intention to
                 construct a one peta flop supercomputer. The
                 construction of this system was based on a cellular
                 architecture the use of relatively small but powerful
                 building blocks used together in sufficient quantities
                 to construct large systems. The first step on the road
                 to a petaflop machine (one quadrillion floating-point
                 operations in a second) is the Blue Gene/L
                 supercomputer. Blue Gene/L combines a low-power
                 processor with a highly parallel architecture to
                 achieve unparalleled computing performance per unit
                 volume. Implementing the Blue Gene/L packaging involved
                 trading off considerations of cost, power, cooling,
                 signaling, electromagnetic radiation, mechanics,
                 component selection, cabling, reliability, service
                 strategy, risk, and schedule. This paper describes how
                 1,024 dual-processor compute application-specific
                 integrated circuits (ASICs) are packaged in a scalable
                 rack, and how racks are combined and augmented with
                 host computers and remote storage. The Blue Gene/L
                 interconnect, power, cooling, and control systems are
                 described individually and as part of the synergistic
                 whole.",

  abstract =     "While developing the protein folding application for
                 the IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer, some frequently
                 executed computational kernels were encountered. These
                 were significantly more complex than the linear algebra
                 kernels that are normally provided as tuned libraries
                 with modern machines. Using regular library functions
                 for these would have resulted in an application that
                 exploited only 5--10\% of the potential floating-point
                 throughput of the machine. This paper is a tour of the
                 functions encountered; they have been expressed in C++
                 (and could be expressed in other languages such as
                 Fortran or C). With the help of a good optimizing
                 compiler, floating-point efficiency is much closer to
                 100\%. The protein folding application was initially
                 run by the life science researchers on IBM POWER3e
                 machines while the computer science researchers were
                 designing and bringing up the Blue Gene/L hardware.
                 Some of the work discussed resulted in enhanced
                 compiler optimizations, which now improve the
                 performance of floating-point-intensive applications
                 compiled by the IBM VisualAgent series of compilers for
                 POWER3, POWER4e, POWER4+, and POWER5. The
                 implementations are offered in the hope that they may
                 help in other implementations of molecular dynamics or
                 in other fields of endeavor, and in the hope that
                 others may adapt the ideas presented here to deliver
                 additional mathematical functions at high throughput.",

  abstract =     "This paper describes the Blue Gene/L advanced
                 diagnostics environment (ADE) used throughout all
                 aspects of the Blue Gene/L project, including design,
                 logic verification, bringup, diagnostics, and
                 manufacturing test. The Blue Gene/L ADE consists of a
                 lightweight multithreaded coherence-managed kernel,
                 runtime libraries, device drivers, system programming
                 interfaces, compilers, and host-based development
                 tools. It provides complete and flexible access to all
                 features of the Blue Gene/L hardware. Prior to the
                 existence of hardware, ADE was used on Very high-speed
                 integrated circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL)
                 models, not only for logic verification, but also for
                 performance measurements, code-path analysis, and
                 evaluation of architectural tradeoffs. During early
                 hardware bring-up, the ability to run in a
                 cycle-reproducible manner on both hardware and VHDL
                 proved invaluable in fault isolation and analysis.
                 However, ADE is also capable of supporting
                 high-performance applications and parallel test cases,
                 thereby permitting us to stress the hardware to the
                 limits of its capabilities. This paper also provides
                 insights into system-level and device-level programming
                 of Blue Gene/L to assist developers of high-performance
                 applications to more fully exploit the performance of
                 the machine.",

                 that embodies the system-on-a-chip concept in its
                 entirety. This paper outlines the salient features of
                 this 130-nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor
                 (CMOS) technology, including the IBM unique embedded
                 dynamic random access memory (DRAM) technology. Crucial
                 to the execution of Blue Gene/L is the simultaneous

                 high-performance static random access memory (SRAM),
                 DRAM, and several other logic design blocks on a

                 other logic design blocks, the SRAM features used in
                 the L2 cache, and the embedded DRAM that forms the L3

                 technology into a higher-performance space in the 90-nm

                 performance analysis tools for the new Blue Gene/L

                 categories: single-node performance tools and multinode
                 performance tools. From a single-node perspective, we

  abstract =     "With up to 65,536 compute nodes and a peak performance
                 of more than 360 teraflops, the Blue Gene/L (BG/L)
                 supercomputer represents a new level of massively
                 parallel systems. The system software stack for BG/L
                 creates a programming and operating environment that
                 harnesses the raw power of this architecture with great
                 effectiveness. The design and implementation of this
                 environment followed three major principles:
                 simplicity, performance, and familiarity. By
                 specializing the services provided by each component of
                 the system architecture, we were able to keep each one
                 simple and leverage the BG/L hardware features to
                 deliver high performance to applications. We also
                 implemented standard programming interfaces and
                 programming languages that greatly simplified the job
                 of porting applications to BG/L. The effectiveness of
                 our approach has been demonstrated by the operational
                 success of several prototype and production machines,
                 which have already been scaled to 16,384 nodes.",

  abstract =     "The Blue Gene/L compute chip is a dual-processor
                 system-on-a-chip capable of delivering an arithmetic
                 peak performance of 5.6 gigaflops. To match the memory
                 speed to the high compute performance, the system
                 implements an aggressive three-level on-chip cache
                 hierarchy. The implemented hierarchy offers high
                 bandwidth and integrated prefetching on cache hierarchy
                 levels 2 and 3 (L2 and L3) to reduce memory access
                 time. A Gigabit Ethernet interface driven by direct
                 memory access (DMA) is integrated in the cache
                 hierarchy, requiring only an external physical link
                 layer chip to connect to the media. The integrated L3
                 cache stores a total of 4 MB of data, using multibank
                 embedded dynamic random access memory (DRAM). The
                 1,024-bit-wide data port of the embedded DRAM provides
                 22.4 GB/s bandwidth to serve the speculative
                 prefetching demands of the two processor cores and the
                 Gigabit Ethernet DMA engine. To reduce hardware
                 overhead due to cache coherence intervention requests,
                 memory coherence is maintained by software. This is
                 particularly efficient for regular highly parallel
                 applications with partitionable working sets. The
                 system further integrates an on-chip double-data-rate
                 (DDR) DRAM controller for direct attachment of main
                 memory modules to optimize overall memory performance
                 and cost. For booting the system and low-latency
                 interprocessor communication and synchronization, a
                 16-KB static random access memory (SRAM) and hardware
                 locks have been added to the design.",

                 designed to be used with the IBM PowerPC 440 processor
                 core on the Blue Gene/L compute chip. The FPU core
                 implements the floating-point instruction set from the

                 primarily single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) and

                 controller, and a bridge interface to slower devices.
                 System-on-a-chip verification problems require a
                 multilevel verification strategy in which the strengths
                 of each layer offset the weaknesses of another layer.
                 The verification strategy we adopted relies on the
                 combined strengths of random simulation, directed
                 simulation, and code-driven simulation at the unit and
                 system levels. The strengths and weaknesses of the
                 various techniques and our reasons for choosing them
                 are discussed. The verification platform is based on
                 event simulation and cycle simulation running on a farm
                 of Intel-processor-based machines, several
                 PowerPC-processor-based machines, and the internally
                 developed hardware accelerator Awan. The
                 cost/performance tradeoffs of the different platforms
                 are analyzed. The success of the first Blue Gene/L
                 nodes, which worked within days of receiving them and
                 had only a small number of undetected bugs (none
                 fatal), reflects both careful design and a
                 comprehensive verification strategy.",

  abstract =     "The performance of supercomputers has traditionally
                 been evaluated using the LINPACK benchmark [3], which
                 stresses only the floating point units without
                 significantly loading the memory or the network
                 subsystems.\par

                 The HPC Challenge (HPCC) benchmark suite is being
                 proposed as an alternative to evaluate the performance
                 of supercomputers. It consists of seven benchmarks,
                 each designed to measure a specific aspect of the
                 system performance. These benchmarks include (i) the
                 high performance LINPACK (HPL) (ii) DGEMM, which
                 measures the floating point rate of execution of double
                 precision real matrix-matrix multiplication, (iii)
                 STREAM that measures sustainable memory bandwidth and
                 the corresponding computation rate for four simple
                 vector kernels, namely, copy, scale, add and triad (iv)
                 PTRANS that exercises the network by taking parallel
                 transpose of a large distributed matrix (v)
                 Randomaccess that measures the rate of integer updates
                 to random memory locations (vi) FFT which measures the
                 floating point rate of execution of a double precision
                 complex one-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform
                 (DFT) and (vii) communication bandwidth and latency
                 which measures latency and bandwidth of a number of
                 simultaneous communication patterns.\par

                 In this paper we outline the optimization techniques
                 used to obtain the presently best reported performance
                 of the HPCC Randomaccess benchmark on the Blue Gene/L

  abstract =     "It has become a national priority to build and use
                 PetaFlop supercomputers. The dependability of such
                 large systems has been recognized as a key issue that
                 can impact their usability. Even with smaller, existing
                 machines, failures are the norm rather than an
                 exception. Research has shown that storage systems are
                 the primary source of faults leading to supercomputer
                 unavailability. In this paper, we envision two
                 mechanisms, namely on-demand data reconstruction and
                 eager data offloading, to address the availability of
                 job input/output data. These two techniques aim to
                 allow parallel jobs and post-job processing tools to
                 continue execution despite storage system failures in
                 supercomputers. Fundamental to both approaches is the
                 definition and acquisition of recovery-related parallel
                 file system metadata, which is then coupled with
                 transparent remote data accesses. Our approach attempts
                 to maximize the utilization of precious supercomputer
                 resources by improving the accessibility of transient
                 job data. Further, the proposed methods are best-effort
                 in nature and complement existing file system recovery
                 schemes, which are designed for persistent data.
                 Several of our previous studies help in demonstrating
                 the feasibility of the proposed approaches.",

                 and future computation intensive applications, there
                 have been many fundamentally divergent approaches such
                 as the Blue-Gene, TRIPS, HERO, Cascade spurred in order
                 to provide increased performance at node level in
                 supercomputing clusters. The design of the node
                 architecture should be such that 'Cost-Effective
                 Supercomputing' is realized without compromising on the
                 requirements of the ever-performance hungry grand
                 challenge applications. However, to increase
                 performance at the cluster level, scalability and
                 likewise tackling the mapping complexity across the
                 large cluster of nodes becomes critical. The potential
                 of such a node architecture can be fully exploited only
                 with an appropriate cluster architecture. In an attempt
                 to address these issues for efficient and
                 Cost-Effective Supercomputing, we propose a novel
                 paradigm for designing High Performance Clusters, in
                 two papers. In paper-II, we discuss the design of
                 operating system and cluster architecture. In this
                 paper, we present a node architecture model based on
                 the Memory In Processor paradigm and discuss the
                 related architectural aspects (ISA, compiler, network
                 interconnection etc). We provide a design space based
                 on the proposed model for which a simulator is
                 developed, with the help of which the performance of
                 such a node architecture is outlined.",

                 would be capable of tackling computational complexity
                 associated with wide class of applications.
                 Furthermore, it was discussed that by appropriately

                 simultaneous web-scale workloads. We hypothesize that
                 for a large class of web-scale workloads the Blue
                 Gene/P platform is an order of magnitude more efficient
                 to purchase and operate than the commodity clusters in
                 use today. Driven by scientific computing demands the
                 Blue Gene designers pursued an aggressive
                 system-on-a-chip methodology that led to a scalable
                 platform composed of air-cooled racks. Each rack
                 contains more than a thousand independent computers

                 ready for the undergraduate classroom? In this panel, a
                 group of educators share their experiences in teaching
                 Grid computing over the past several years and in
                 various settings, and discuss how the subject materials
                 should be developed for the future. Key points under
                 discussion include the place in the undergraduate
                 curriculum, the role of programming exercises,
                 bottom-up versus top-down approaches, and the necessary
                 Grid computing platform. This panel will be of interest
                 to those who teach the subject, and those who wish to
                 introduce Grid computing into their programs. It will
                 also interest those who do not want to offer a full

  abstract =     "Cloud computing is rapidly increasing in popularity.
                 Companies such as RedHat, Microsoft, Amazon, Google,
                 and IBM are increasingly funding cloud computing
                 infrastructure and research, making it important for
                 students to gain the necessary skills to work with
                 cloud-based resources. This paper presents a free,
                 educational research platform called Seattle that is
                 community-driven, a common denominator for diverse
                 platform types, and is broadly deployed. Seattle is
                 community-driven --- universities donate available
                 compute resources on multi-user machines to the
                 platform. These donations can come from systems with a
                 wide variety of operating systems and architectures,
                 removing the need for a dedicated infrastructure.
                 Seattle is also surprisingly flexible and supports a
                 variety of pedagogical uses because as a platform it
                 represents a common denominator for cloud computing,
                 grid computing, peer-to-peer networking, distributed
                 systems, and networking. Seattle programs are portable.
                 Students' code can run across different operating
                 systems and architectures without change, while the
                 Seattle programming language is expressive enough for
                 experimentation at a fine-grained level. Our current
                 deployment of Seattle consists of about one thousand
                 computers that are distributed around the world. We
                 invite the computer science education community to
                 employ Seattle in their courses.",

  abstract =     "Runtime Reconfiguration (RTR) has been traditionally
                 utilized as a means for exploiting the flexibility of
                 High-Performance Reconfigurable Computers (HPRCs).
                 However, the RTR feature comes with the cost of high
                 configuration overhead which might negatively impact
                 the overall performance. Currently, modern FPGAs have
                 more advanced mechanisms for reducing the configuration
                 overheads, particularly Partial Runtime Reconfiguration
                 (PRTR). It has been perceived that PRTR on HPRC systems
                 can be the trend for improving the performance. In this
                 work, we will investigate the potential of PRTR on HPRC
                 by formally analyzing the execution model and
                 experimentally verifying our analytical findings by
                 enabling PRTR for the first time, to the best of our
                 knowledge, on one of the current HPRC systems, Cray
                 XD1. Our approach is general and can be applied to any
                 of the available HPRC systems. The paper will conclude
                 with recommendations and conditions, based on our
                 conceptual and experimental work, for the optimal
                 utilization of PRTR as well as possible future usage in
                 HPRC.",

                 the sake of portability, simplicity, flexibility, and
                 efficiency, the FGMRES solvers have been implemented in
                 Fortran 77 using the reverse communication mechanism
                 for the matrix-vector product, the preconditioning, and
                 the dot-product computations. For distributed-memory

                 computational fabrics for the emerging nanocomputing
                 systems due to their ultra-high speed and integration
                 density. However, the imperfect bottom-up self-assembly
                 fabrication leads to excessive defects that have become
                 a barrier for achieving reliable computing. In
                 addition, transient errors continue to be a problem.
                 The massive parallelism rendered by nanoscale
                 integration opens up new opportunities but also poses
                 challenges on how to manage such massive resources for
                 reliable and high-performance computing. In this paper,
                 we propose a nanoarchitecture solution to address these
                 emerging challenges. By using dynamic redundancy
                 allocation, the massive parallelism is exploited to
                 jointly achieve fault (defect/error) tolerance and high
                 performance. Simulation results demonstrate the
                 effectiveness of the proposed technique under a range

                 concepts, creating Web and Grid services, and then

                 middleware, security mechanisms and job submission all

                 production-style Grid portal, registration process, and
                 job submission, and then leading into infrastructure
                 details. We incorporate seven assignments, several of
                 which require students to install Grid computing
                 software on their own computer or lab computers rather
                 than using centralized servers. Students complete a

  abstract =     "The National Science Foundation released a set of
                 application benchmarks that would be a key factor in
                 selecting the next-generation high-performance
                 computing environment. These benchmarks consist of six
                 codes that require large amount of memory and work with
                 large data sets. Here we study the complexity,
                 performance and scalability of these codes on three SGI
                 machines: a 512-processor Altix 3700, a 512-processor
                 Altix 3700/BX2 and 512-processor dual-core based Altix
                 4700; and a 128-processor Cray Opteron cluster
                 interconnected by the Myrinet network. We evaluated
                 these codes for two different problem sizes using
                 different numbers of processors. Our results show that
                 some of these codes scale up very well as we increase
                 the number of processors while others scaled up poorly.
                 Also, one code achieved about 2/3 of the peak rate of
                 an SGI Altix processor. Moreover, the dual-core system
                 achieved comparable performance results to the
                 single-core system.",

  abstract =     "Major breakthroughs in chip and software design have
                 been observed for the last nine years. In October 2001,
                 IBM released the world's first multicore processor:
                 POWER4. Six years later, in February 2007, NVIDIA made
                 a public release of CUDA SDK, a set of development
                 tools to write algorithms for execution on Graphic
                 Processing Units (GPUs). Although software vendors have
                 started working on parallelizing their products, the
                 vast majority of existing code is still sequential and
                 does not effectively utilize modern multicore CPUs and
                 manycore GPUs.\par

                 This article describes Parallel Colt, a multithreaded
                 Java library for scientific computing and image
                 processing. In addition to describing the design and
                 functionality of Parallel Colt, a comparison to MATLAB
                 is presented. Two ImageJ plugins for iterative image
                 deblurring and motion correction of PET brain images
                 are described as typical applications of this library.
                 Performance comparisons with MATLAB, including GPU
                 computations via AccelerEyes' Jacket toolbox are also
                 given.",

                 brief introduction to the field of scientific computer
                 performance, the text provides comprehensive coverage
                 of performance measurement and tools, performance
                 modeling, and automatic performance tuning. It also
                 includes performance tools and techniques for
                 real-world scientific applications. Various chapters
                 address such topics as performance benchmarks, hardware
                 performance counters, the PMaC modeling system, source
                 code-based performance modeling, climate modeling
                 codes, automatic tuning with ATLAS, and much more.",

  abstract =     "In 2001, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
                 called for the creation of commercially viable
                 computing systems that would not only perform at very
                 high levels but also be highly productive. The
                 forthcoming POWER7-IH system known as Productive,
                 Easy-to-use, Reliable Computing System (PERCS) was
                 IBM's response to this challenge. Compared with
                 state-of-the-art high-performance computing systems in
                 existence today, PERCS has very high performance and
                 productivity goals and achieves them through tight
                 integration of computing, networking, storage, and
                 software. This paper describes the PERCS hardware and
                 software, along with many of the design decisions that
                 went into its creation.",

  abstract =     "Regulation of gene expression is a carefully regulated
                 phenomenon in the cell. ``Reverse-engineering''
                 algorithms try to reconstruct the regulatory
                 interactions among genes from genome-scale measurements
                 of gene expression profiles (microarrays). Mammalian
                 cells express tens of thousands of genes; hence,
                 hundreds of gene expression profiles are necessary in
                 order to have acceptable statistical evidence of
                 interactions between genes. As the number of profiles
                 to be analyzed increases, so do computational costs and
                 memory requirements. In this work, we designed and
                 developed a parallel computing algorithm to
                 reverse-engineer genome-scale gene regulatory networks
                 from thousands of gene expression profiles. The
                 algorithm is based on computing pairwise Mutual
                 Information between each gene-pair. We successfully
                 tested it to reverse engineer the Mus Musculus (mouse)
                 gene regulatory network in liver from gene expression
                 profiles collected from a public repository. A parallel
                 hierarchical clustering algorithm was implemented to
                 discover ``communities'' within the gene network.
                 Network communities are enriched for genes involved in
                 the same biological functions. The inferred network was
                 used to identify two mitochondrial proteins.",

  abstract =     "With the ever increasing popularity of smart phones,
                 mobile services have been evolving rapidly to allow
                 users to enjoy localized and personalized experiences.
                 Users can discover local information and keep connected
                 with family and friends on the go, and ultimately to
                 experience the convergence of cyber space and physical
                 world where digital technologies are interwoven into
                 the day-to-day life. A pivotal component of such a
                 cyber-physical convergence is the contextual
                 intelligence. The extraction and dissemination of
                 contextual information around users is the key for the
                 cyber capabilities to be applied to physical activities
                 and for the cyber world to better reflect the physical
                 reality. In this talk, we shall address some issues
                 arising from context-based mobile services. In
                 particular, we discuss how mobility impacts contextual
                 relevancy and personalization in mobile services. The
                 relevancy and timeliness of contextual information not
                 only are essential for these services to deliver great
                 user experiences, but also put significant computation
                 pressure on service infrastructure that processes
                 continuous data streams in real time and disseminate

                 provides for lightweight remote direct memory access
                 (RDMA) between nodes, which is useful for implementing
                 partitioned global address space (PGAS) languages like
                 UPC and Co-Array Fortran. In this paper, we perform a
                 study of Gemini performance using a set of
                 communication microbenchmarks and compare the
                 performance of one-sided communication in PGAS
                 languages with two-sided MPI. Our results demonstrate
                 the performance benefits of the PGAS model on Gemini
                 hardware, showing in what circumstances and by how much
                 one-sided communication outperforms two-sided in terms
                 of messaging rate, aggregate bandwidth, and computation
                 and communication overlap capability. For example, for
                 8-byte and 2KB messages the one-sided messaging rate is
                 5 and 10 times greater respectively than the two-sided
                 one. The study also reveals important information about
                 how to optimize one-sided Gemini communication.",

                 harboring reconfigurable devices, such as
                 field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), are gaining
                 more widespread interest. Such systems range from
                 supercomputers with tightly coupled reconfigurable
                 hardware to clusters with reconfigurable devices at
                 each node. The use of these architectures for
                 scientific computing provides an alternative for
                 computationally demanding problems and has advantages
                 in metrics, such as operating cost/performance and
                 power/performance. However, performance optimization of
                 these systems can be challenging even with knowledge of
                 the system's characteristics. Our analytic performance
                 model includes parameters representing the
                 reconfigurable hardware, application load imbalance
                 across the nodes, background user load, basic
                 message-passing communication, and processor
                 heterogeneity. In this article, we provide an overview
                 of the analytical model and demonstrate its application
                 for optimization and scheduling of high-performance
                 reconfigurable computing (HPRC) resources. We examine
                 cost functions for minimum runtime and other
                 optimization problems commonly found in shared
                 computing resources. Finally, we discuss additional
                 scheduling issues and other potential applications of
                 the model.",

  abstract =     "With the advances in computing power, high-performance
                 computing (HPC) platforms have had an impact on not
                 only scientific research in advanced organizations but
                 also computer science curriculum in the educational
                 community. For example, multicore programming and
                 parallel systems are highly desired courses in the
                 computer science major. However, the high cost of HPC
                 equipment and maintenance makes it hard to be adapted
                 into a conventional computer science curriculum.
                 Specifically, teaching-oriented institutions cannot
                 afford an HPC system due to the high cost, lack of
                 experience, and smaller research infrastructure. The
                 main objective of this article is to present an
                 affordable and easy-to-use high-performance cluster
                 system for teaching-oriented computer science
                 curriculums. In order to address this, we have designed
                 and implemented an affordable high-performance cluster
                 system based on the PlayStation 3 (PS3). For the
                 performance evaluation of the PS3 cluster, we conducted
                 a benchmarking test, that is, matrix multiplication,
                 with different numbers of synergistic processing
                 elements (SPEs) and nodes. As a result, it was
                 concluded that the PS3Cluster provides enough computing
                 power as an HPC for computer science courses, while the
                 total cost is less than 10\% of an existing cluster
                 system on the market that has similar performance. In
                 addition, the implemented PS3Cluster system has been
                 used for computer science courses, such as Parallel and
                 Distributed Databases and Parallel Programming.",

                 important sub-problems of middleware design, such as
                 scheduling, data management, security, load balancing,
                 and fault tolerance. With numerous tables and
                 illustrations, the text balances the theory of
                 designing desktop grid middleware and architecture with
                 practical applications and real-world deployment on
                 large scale platforms. Each chapter presents
                 sub-problems, discusses the theoretical and practical
                 issues, details chosen implementation and experiments,
                 and offers references for further reading.",
