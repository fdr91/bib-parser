Test by Carles Pina.  Was throwing nesting mismatch
error to console in citeproc-js.

The "term-join" element is no longer present in citeproc-js,
as of release 1.0.150, but this test now also checks for
correct classification of elements with family name only
and the "isInstitution" flag as institutional authors
(which should trigger an "and" join, in citeproc-js).
