Do something for stop-words and quoted titles, and journal names
(pretty-much done, needs check against threads below):

Refine handling of names, with flexible style-specific handling for
Myanmar, Japanese, Mongolian, etc.

  cs:style-options name-as-sort-order="ja zh kr my" (done)
  cs:style-options name-never-short="ja zh kr my"   (done)

  cs:style-options multilingual-suppress-tag="ja" multilingual-suppress-family="names"
  (??? or somesuch)

The explicit name-as-sort-order and name-never-short options take
precedence over the regexp-based guesswork.

Fix this one:

Look at the bookmarks on the iPad for some more recent issues.

Check the assignment of title vs container-title in the Abbreviation
Filter (I think this is right, but check)

Check operation of <text variable="authority" form="short"/> when used
in bibliography.

Look into German parallel cites.

Add some arbitration panels maybe. These may not require special cite
conventions, but it would be useful for organizing research to be able
to identify them:

    International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)
    Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)
    Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ)
    International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)
    International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)
    Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (SCC)
    London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA)
    Cairo Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (CRCICA)
    China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC)
    Court Of Justice of the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA)
    Inter-American Court Of Human Rights (IACHR)
    Court of Justice of the Andean Community (TJAC)
    Central American Court Of Justice (CCJ)
    African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR)
    Court Of Justice of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
    International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
    International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)
